# Terminal

This lesson is a beginner's guide to using **command-line interface** tools for coding and data-journalism. It is designed for students who may have never used a terminal program before but are taking my [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class) class.

I use a Mac, and there are some differences for Windows users. The first major difference is Windows users have to install Git (and Git Bash, which comes with it) before we can go much further.

## Windows uses must install Git first

Windows users have to install Git and Git Bash before doing moving forward with this lesson. These next few steps do that.

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), our source code version control program. This will allow us to save our code in steps. This will also install **Git Bash**, which will be your Terminal app.

There is one point in the installation process where you need to set "Use Git from Git Bash only".

- Use the default settings for everything else.
- You should now be able to find **Git Bash** from your Windows Start menu.
