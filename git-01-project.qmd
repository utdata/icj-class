# Project setup

This is something we'll do time and again. Don't just follow the steps blindly ... learn and understand what you are doing so you can do this without thinking much about it.

## Folders and files

1. Use the Finder on your computer to locate your `Documents/icj` folder and inside of it create a new project folder called `yourname-git-practice`. Always use all lower-case letters and dashes instead of space. It's just good practice.
2. Launch Visual Studio Code and start a **New window**. (You can find it under the File menu, or use *Command-option-n*.)
3. On the Welcome screen, you will see a link called **Open folder**. (If you don't see this, click on the page icon at top-left, which is the Explorer menu.) Click on that Open Folder button and negotiate your way to your project folder, select it and click the **Open** button.

4. Go to the Terminal menu and choose New Terminal. This will open a terminal window inside of VS Code, which is super handy. The top line of the terminal should give you the path to inside your project folder, like `~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice`. If it doesn't then you didn't open the folder first.

## The README

Every coding project should have a special file called a [README file](https://www.makeareadme.com/) which outlines what the project is and how to use it. It is often written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), which is a text-based syntax that Github turns into pretty HTML when it is published, but is completely readable as text. It also has great support to show code, tables, lists and such. Here is a [cheatsheet of the syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) and [10-minute tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) you may find useful. For what it is worth, this book is written using Markdown.

I want you to _always_ have a README file with your projects, and it should _always_ be called `README.md`. Yes, with capital letters for `README` and lower-case letters for `.md`. It breaks typical file naming conventions because it is special.

(I have a gif showing these steps below.)

1. Create the file first. I would recommend using the Terminal inside VS Code and doing `touch README.md`. (There are other ways, but let's get used to using `touch`).
2. The file now appears in the file explorer in VS Code on the left. You can click on that to open it.
3. Now add a title, your name, the assignment name and when it is due. Like this:

```md
# Christian's git practice

By Christian McDonald, Intro Coding for Journalists class

This repo is a class assignment to learn git. It is due Month Day, Year.
```

![Make readme](images/make-readme.gif)

4. Update the files with your info, save and close it.

I want something like that on every project you make in this class: **title, your name, the assignment and when it is due**. Your projects early in the class won't have an extensive README [like some others](https://github.com/utdata/jedr-academy#readme), but I want you to be in the habit of using them.

## Using gitignore

Your computer and the programs that run on it create all kinds of hidden files that you don't normally see. When looking in folders with the VS Code explorer, you might see a Mac file called `.DS_Store`, which is a hidden file the computer creates when you view a folder. On Windows, you might see `.Thumbs.db`, which is a record of images saved in a folder. We often don't want to save these files or others into our git history, so we create another hidden file called a [.gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) file to tell git to ignore certain things. An easy way to create one is to use the website [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/).

Creating hidden files like the `.gitignore` through the Mac/Windows regular file structure can be tricky, so it is best to do it from a terminal.

1. In your Integrated Terminal in VS Code type this command:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Yes, that file name starts with a period and there is NO file extension suffix, so no `.txt` or anything ... it should be just `.gitignore`. Once created, it should show up in your list of files in VS Code on the left-hand screen.

2. Go ahead and open the `.gitignore` file in VS Code by double-clicking on in the explorer.
1. Go to the website [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) in a browser. Type in "VisualStudioCode" and choose it from the list. (Make sure is it "VisualStudioCode" and not just "VisualStudio"). Type in "macOS" and add it, then "Windows" and add it to the list. Do them both, even if you only work on a Mac, just to be nice for future collaborators. (If you were using other programs like MicrosoftOffice or languages like Python, you would add those as well.) Click the **Create** button.
1. Copy all the code there and paste it into your `.gitignore` file and then **save it**. You can then close the file.


Here's a short video showing that process:

{{< video https://vimeo.com/845075320 >}}


## Creating a repo

One you have your initial files, there are a number of steps you go through to create the repo, track files, save them, and then publish them to Github.

You'll set up the repo for each new project in the class. And then once made, you'll cycle through saving substeps often.

### Initialize the repo

The first part step to making a repo is to tell you computer to track the project by "initializing" it. We'll do these commands in our integrated Terminal.

1. Use the following command in your terminal to "initialize" or start the repo.

```bash
git init
```

In response you'll get something like ...

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ccm346/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice/.git/
```

... with your repo path at the end.

### Check status

Now to show that git is paying attention, let's peek at what git things is going on with your repo by using `git status`. You don't _have_ do this step at this time ... in fact you can do this one at any time you want. 

```bash
git status
```

And the response you get ...

```
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git is telling us here that there are two files in our repo that are "untracked", meaning they are there but git isn't paying attention to them. Let's fix that.

### Stage changes

Next we will "stage" our files by adding them to the list of tracked files. You sometimes don't want to track all your files, so you can add each one using their file name. That said we often track all of them, so we'll use a shortcut:

```bash
git add .
```

If it goes well, you **WON'T GET A RESPONSE**. Sometimes no response is good because it did what you wanted with no errors!

This added (or "staged") a list of files for git to "track" or pay attention to. In our case we added all our files in the folder that aren't outlined in the `.gitignore` file. You can run `git status` again if you want to see the difference.

### Commit changes

Next we want to "commit" our files (which means save them) and include a message to say why we made changes to these files. ALWAYS include the `-m` flag when you commit, with a message.

Do this command in your Terminal. Note the quotes:

```bash
git commit -m "my first commit"
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
$ git commit -m "my first commit"
[main (root-commit) b4fde58] my first commit
 2 files changed, 82 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Here is a gif of the whole process, though I have `git status` mixed in there.

![first commit](images/first-commit.gif)

Congratulations ... you have now saved a snapshot in time of all these files.

### Creating your public Github repo

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) (and log in if you are not) and find the + sign at the top right.
1. Click on that and choose **New repository**.
    - Name the repo the same as your local one: `yourname-git-practice`. (I always name my Github repo the same name as the folder on my computer for clarity, but know they technically could be different.)
    - Give it a description so you know what it is later.
    - Keep it Public.
    - DO NOT include a README here, or a gitignore or license.
    - Click **Create repository**.

Once you create the repo, you'll get a page back with a lot of code.

3. Make sure the `SSH` button is selected in the top box. (We are selecting this because during your computer setup we set up SSH keys between your computer and Github.)
1. Go to the second block **"… or push an existing repository from the command line"** and copy the first line there that starts with **`git remote add origin`**. Pro Tip: Triple-click on the line to highlight it.
1. Paste that line into your Terminal and run it.

![Connect to Github](images/00-connect-github.png)

We shouldn't need that second line there because our branch should already be named `main`.

6. But we do a modified version of that last line:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Here is and explanation of Terminal commands we used.

- The `git remote add` command created a connection between your local project and the repo you created on Github. Now your local files are are linked to those stored on the Internet.
- With `git push` line you pushed your local files to the "origin" on Github on the "main" branch.

We only have to do the `git remote add` line once, but we'll often use `git push origin main` to push your code.

7. Go back to your Github repo and refresh the page you'll see your new files listed there.

### Adding a new file

We're going to use the Integrated Terminal again (I'm just going to say "terminal" from now on) to create yet another a new file, commit it, and then push it to Github.

1. Go into the terminal and use the `touch` command to create a new file, **using your name** for the file name. It will be a Markdown file:

```bash
touch myname.md
```

2. You'll notice the file show up in the list of files in the File Explorer on the left. Click on that and it will open the file in the editor.
1. Add a headline and some text to the file, like this below:

``` markdown
# A new Markdown page

I'm learning git and Github and this repo will help me. Don't judge.
```

::: callout
If we didn't talk about Markdown in detail earlier, now is a good time to review the [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
:::


You can save the file, but keep it open.

## The git cycle

There are typically three steps to committing code in git:

- `git add` to stage files that have changed.
- `git commit -m` to commit (or save) the files. We'll add the message at the same time.
- `git push origin <branch>` to publish the changes to Github. We will almost always be using the `main` branch.

There is a fourth command we also use with the three above, but you can do it at any time to check where you are in the git workflow:

- `git status` to check what files have changed, etc.

We use these commands A LOT.

Let's check the status of our repo.

1. Go into the Terminal, get your status:

```bash
git status
```

Here is my command and response:

```
$ git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        christian.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

I have one untracked file, `christian.md`, and Git has been nice enough to tell me how to stage my file.

2. Let's add it specifically (but use your file name).

```bash
git add christian.md
```

Here is the command and response:

```
$ git add christian.md 
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|●1]
```

There wasn't really a response back because it "worked", but because I have the git-bash-prompt extension installed (which we installed earlier), I have some feedback. We haven't talked about that yet, but that part `[main L|●1]` tells me we are on the `main` branch (more on that later) and that I have one staged file. Just watch how those signals change as we go through the cycle.

3. Now let's commit the file. We will also add a "message" to the commit using the flag `-m`, which you should ALWAYS do. It's good coding practice.

```bash
git commit -m "adding my new file"
```

Here is the call and response:

```
$ git commit -m "adding my new file"
[main eda683e] adding my new file
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 christian.md
 (base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|✔] 
```

Congrats! You have made your second commit, saving this point in time on your computer. Note the git bash prompt how has a checkmark at the end `[main L|✔]`, noting there are no uncommited files.

Our next step is to push that new change to Github.

4. Use the `git push origin main` command to push this to Github.

```bash
git push origin main
```

Here is the command and the response:

```
$ git push origin main
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 410 bytes | 410.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To github.com:critmcdonald/christian-git-practice.git
   75090ef..eda683e  main -> main
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|✔] 
```

That's a lot of mumbo jumbo that we don't have to understand details of, we just have to recognize that it did "Writing" and you didn't get an error.

Why `origin main`? This is the part that sends this to our Github repo to share with the world. The `main` part is the branch name, and that is something we may get into later in the semester.

5. Now go back to your Github repo in your browser and hit refresh on your repo, and you'll see the result there. Woo hoo!

### Repeat: Add, commit, push

Now let's make another change to your file and repeat the cycle.

1. Go into VS Code and add a new sentence to your `myname.md` file.
1. Use the terminal to check the status of your repo using `git status`.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   christian.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|✚ 1] 
```

The return says we have one modified file, `christian.md`. Since it is the only modified file and we want to stage it, we'll use a fancy command to add "all" the modified files so we don't have to name it. The period means "all changed files".

1. Do `git add .` as noted below and you'll get this response:

```
$ git add .
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|●1]
```

There is no response for staging a file if it is successful.

1. Now finish it out by adding a commit and message as noted below:

```
$ git commit -m "adding changes"
[main 3c4dbe4] adding changes
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|✔] 
```

1. And then push the changes to Github:

```
$ git push origin main
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 316 bytes | 316.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
To github.com:critmcdonald/christian-git-practice.git
   eda683e..3c4dbe4  main -> main
(base) ✔ ~/Documents/icj/christian-git-practice [main L|✔] 
```

Well done! You've learned the basic git cycle and pushed code to Github.

## Turn in your assignment

In Canvas, find "Version control assignment" and submit the URL of your Github repo.

## If you forget -m

If you are committing files with `git commit` and you forget to add the `-m` flag or the message in quotes after it, you will get thrown into an odd program called VIM. It will look something like this:

![vim commit](images/vim-commit.png)

If this happens:

1. Press `i` on your keyboard to get into _insert_ mode.
2. Type your commit message into that first line.
3. Hit the `esc` key at the top left of your keyboard to get out of _insert_ mode.
4. Type `:wq` on your keyboard. Your cursor will move to the bottom of the window. That is OK.
5. Hit return to end the command.

You'll get thrown back into your regular Terminal and be able to continue.

I don't want to get into what the VIM commands are, but basically `:wq` means "write" and "quit".

This GIF shows the process, but not the keystrokes, so use the directions above. Best yet, DON'T FORGET `-m`!
