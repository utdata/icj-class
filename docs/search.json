Bash is a Unix-based program and most of the Internet runs on Unix (or Linux) computers.\nWindows doesn’t understand Bash at all without the help of another program. This is why we installed Git and Git Bash so we can all speak the same language. (If you are a Windows user and haven’t yet installed Git, do it now.)\nMacs understand Bash natively, but some day they will change to a similar language called zsh. When you launch a shell on newer Macs you might get a message The default interactive shell is now zsh. To update your account to use zsh, please run chsh -s /bin/zsh. DON’T DO THIS! JUST IGNORE IT. We will continue to use Bash. Later we will add a command to disable this message. If somehow your terminal gets set to use zsh, you can check and/or change it to Bash.",

Every directory has these, so that’s why the ls -l always shows two items inside a directory, even if it is “empty” of regular files or folders.\nWe can use these “dot” and “dot dot” designations to move around into different directories, and to manage files in our current directories. They become super important when we make “paths” between files in our programs and web pages.\nLet’s see this “dot” designation in action by opening our “current” folder in Finder.

We are going set up a place to store our projects so they are NOT backedup to cloud services. We do this for a couple of reasons:\n\nLater projects in this class will include thousands of tiny files. The process of writing them back forth to the cloud service can affect computer performance.\nOur projects use these files in order to function, and when they get off-loaded to the cloud then our code has problems working.\n\nDon’t worry … we’ll back up your class work through Github.",

    "text": "3.9 On the right path\n\n3.9.1 Relative paths\nYou can ls files or cd into any directory relative to your current working directory using ../ to move “up” the folder structure and then use the name of the new directory to move inside it. So a path like this: ls ../../Users/Cory is to travel up two folders, then into Users then into Cory and then list all the files there.\nThis is very powerful in programming, because you might be writing and testing code on your own computer, but then run the program on another computer, so if file01.py needs to talk to file02.py, you don’t want to hard-code a path like http://utdata.cmcdonald.com/scripts/file02.py, because you might not always be on utdata.cmcdonald.com. If it’s in the same folder, you could use file02.py or ./file02.py.\n\n\n3.9.2 Root-relative paths\nYou can reference the “root” or the top level of whatever server or machine you are on even if you don’t know the name of it, by starting your path with a slash like this: /scripts/file01.py. That’s called a root-relative path. If you know the root-relative path to a file or folder, you can always find it no matter what directory you are currently in. We won’t use this much in this class.\n\n\n3.9.3 Absolute paths\nAn absolute path includes the domain or computer name. If I reference http://utdata.cmcdonald.com/scripts/file01.py in my code or script, it will only work if I’m on utdata.cmcdonald.com. If I move that script to another computer or server, it will still try to pull from utdata.cmcdonald.com instead of the version on the new computer. We avoid using absolute paths in this class for this reason.\n\n\n3.9.4 The home directory shortcut\nThere is also a path shortcut called ~/ that stands for “the home directory of the logged in person”. You might see that referenced in paths like ~/Documents/ but that would really take me to /Users/ccm346/Documents/ on my computer. But what’s cool is the same ~/Documents/ path works on YOUR computer, even though your user directory name is different.",

    "text": "4.1 Defining version control\nMake sure you’ve installed VS Code, Git, and have configured as outlined in ICJ Setting Up Part 1 before continuing here.\nSearch on google and you’ll find a ton of posts, tutorials and videos about Git and version control systems. I encourage you to explore some that fit your learning style. We’ll just cover enough here to get you going and we’ll learn by doing.\nAt its most basic, Git allows you to save your work at intervals and it keeps a history of files on your computer when you choose to save them. Once you have something that works, you can “commit” it and leave a comment about what you’ve done. You can then go back to that exact point in time if you need to. This frees the developer to experiment and make changes that may NOT work, because you know you can always go back. It works for any kind of file you want to put under version control.\nGit allows for a “distributed” version control system, meaning that all the code can be stored on a central server (like on the Internet) so other people can work on the shared code. When they “check out” a repository (or repo), they get the entire code base. Contributors can then make changes and “check in” those changes for others to use.\nGithub is the central server we will use to save our code. It’s also a project management tool and a social network of sorts. It’s probably the most popular programming service on the planet. Bitbucket Cloud is another popular code sharing service.",

It also has great support to show code, tables, lists and such. Here is a cheatsheet of the syntax and 10-minute tutorial you may find useful. For what it is worth, this book is written using Markdown.\nI want you to always have a README file with your projects, and it should always be called README.md.

    "text": "5.3 Using gitignore\nYour computer and the programs that run on it create all kinds of hidden files that you don’t normally see. When looking in folders with the VS Code explorer, you might see a Mac file called .DS_Store, which is a hidden file the computer creates when you view a folder. On Windows, you might see .Thumbs.db, which is a record of images saved in a folder. We often don’t want to save these files or others into our git history, so we create another hidden file called a .gitignore which contains the rules of what not to track. An easy way to write the rules is to use the website gitignore.io.\nCreating hidden files like the .gitignore through the Mac/Windows regular file structure can be tricky, so it is best to do it from a terminal.\n\nIn your Integrated Terminal in VS Code type this command:\n\ntouch .gitignore\nYes, that file name starts with a period and there is NO file extension suffix, so no .txt or anything … it should be just .gitignore. Once created, it should show up in your list of files in VS Code on the left-hand screen.\n\nGo ahead and open the .gitignore file in VS Code by double-clicking on in the explorer.\nGo to the website gitignore.io in a browser. Type in “VisualStudioCode” and choose it from the list. (Make sure it says “VisualStudioCode” and not just “VisualStudio”). Type in “macOS” and add it, then “Windows” and add it to the list. Always do both platforms to be nice for future collaborators. (If you were using other programs like MicrosoftOffice or languages like Python, you would add those as well.) Click the Create button.\nCopy all the code there and paste it into your .gitignore file and then save it. You can then close the file.\n\nHere’s a short video showing that process:",

Let’s fix that.\n\n\n6.1.3 Stage changes\nNext we will “stage” our files by adding them to the list of tracked files. You sometimes don’t want to track all your files, so you can add each one using their file name. That said we often track all of them, so we’ll use a shortcut:\ngit add .\nIf it goes well, you WON’T GET A RESPONSE. Sometimes no response is good because it did what you wanted with no errors!\nThis added (or “staged”) a list of files for git to “track” or pay attention to. In our case we added all our files in the folder that aren’t outlined in the .gitignore file. You can run git status again if you want to see the difference.\n\n\n6.1.4 Commit changes\nNext we want to “commit” our files (which means save them) and include a message to say why we made changes to these files. ALWAYS include the -m flag when you commit, with a message.\nDo this command in your Terminal. Note the quotes:\ngit commit -m \"my first commit\"\nYou should get a response similar to this:\n$ git commit -m \"my first commit\"\n[main (root-commit) b4fde58] my first commit\n 2 files changed, 82 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .gitignore\n create mode 100644 README.md\nHere is a gif of the whole process, though I have git status mixed in there.\n\n\n\nfirst commit\n\n\nCongratulations … you have now saved a snapshot in time of all these files.",

We haven’t talked about that yet, but that part [main L|●1] tells me we are on the main branch (more on that later) and that I have one staged file. Just watch how those signals change as we go through the cycle.\n\nNow let’s commit the file.

    "text": "8.4 Build a recipe web page\nWe’re going to build the HTML structure for the recipe page noted above. I’ll supply the text that you need to turn into HTML markup. While there are AI tools that could do all that work for us, you wouldn’t learn chat-shit from that. We’re going to code this up with VS Code so we can talk about the elements as we go along.\nIn our first pass here, we’ll mark up the text items for what physically are … their HTML bone structure. We’ll add some semantic tags a little later.\n\n8.4.1 Create the file\n\nCreate and save a new HTML document called recipe.html. You can use the touch command to do this.\n\nNext we need the basic elements required for an HTML 5 document. There is a super easy way to do this thanks to a special thing in VS Code called Emmet.\n\nAt the top of the file, type html and you’ll see some selections come up. Use the arrow key on your keyboard to choose the option html:5 and hit return. You should get all the boilerplate elements you need for an HTML page.\n\n\n\n\nHTML boilerplate gif\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 About indenting code\nA quick aside here: Notice how that boilerplate HTML code is formatted. Tags that are inside of one another are indented to show their relationship. This is shown with the &lt;meta&gt; tags inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.\nAs you write code in VS Code it will try to do this for you, and you need to let it help you. This indenting syntax is super helpful as code gets more complicated.\nStrive to write beautiful code.\n\n\n8.4.3 Collect the text\nNow to save some mindless typing, I’ve saved a copy of the unstyled text for you.\n\nControl-click on this link to open the text we need into a browser window, then highlight and copy the contents.\nPaste the contents in between the &lt;body&gt; tags of your recipe.html document.\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Headlines\nThe first line in our text is the headline of the article, and that next needs to be in two places in our HTML document:\n\nCopy the text “Creamy Baked Macaroni and Cheese” and paste it inside a &lt;title&gt; tag in the head of the document. The &lt;title&gt; tag is what’s displayed in the tab of your browser.\nGo back to the body of the text and add &lt;h1&gt; tags around that line to make a main headline.\n\nWhen you created the &lt;h1&gt; tag, VS Code likely added both the opening and closing h1 tags, and you had to cut ‘n’ paste or delete/retype the closing tag in the correct place. Let’s introduce Emmet, which is a shorthand syntax and tool for programmers to help write code. It is baked into VS Code.\nWe’ll use the next line “Brought to you by New York Times Cooking” as a h2 headline, and we’ll want to use an anchor tag around “New York Times Cooking” to link to the original recipe. We’ll use Emmet to help use write the code.\nThere are two parts to using Emmet to mark up existing code, after highlighting your text:\n\nYou invoke the Command Palette in VS code and choose the Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation function\nThen you type in the tag or tags to apply based on Emmet shorthand. The shorthand isn’t hard as it is based mostly on the tags themselves without the angle brackets.\n\nLet’s show an example of how it works. I do this in two steps … I apply the &lt;h2&gt; tag to all of the text, and then apply an anchor tag &lt;a href=\"\"&gt; to just the name of the publication.\nWatch what happens to the code (line 11) as I choose which tags to apply.\n\n\n\nEmmet use on headline\n\n\nHere is how you do the same:\n\nHighlight the text “Brought to you by New York Times Cooking”.\nDo command-shift-p to bring up the Command Palette in VS Code. (Control-shift-p for Windows.)\nBegin typing in the text “Emmet: Wrap” and you’ll see the list of commands filter down. Use your arrow keys to select Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation and hit return. That list of commands will go away but a new box will appear so you can type in the next command.\nType in the text h2 and hit return. This will wrap your text in both the beginning and ending &lt;h2&gt; tags.\nNow, do the same thing to apply the anchor tag around the text “New York Times Cooking”. The Emmet tag for anchor is just a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEmmet is really cool, but it only helps you write the code you already know you want. In other words, you have to know HTML syntax before you can use Emmet’s shorter syntax to write it. Luckily it’s not hard to figure out. Some useful resources for Emmet:\n\nDocumentation\nSyntax cheatsheet\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.5 Adding class\nThe next line of our file is the byline for the recipe article. The byline is a simple text element, so it should be inside a &lt;p&gt; tag, but we will add a “class” to this element so we can target it later as CSS.\nI’m not going to get into what a class is just yet as that is the next lesson, but I do want to show how Emmet allows us to add a class while marking up text. This time I’ll give the steps, then show it.\n\nHighlight the text “By Eric Kim”.\nDo command-shift-p to bring up the Command Palette.\nThe Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation command is probably at the top since you used it last, so you can just hit Return.\nFor the Emmet syntax, use p.byline.\n\nThe p part is to add the &lt;p&gt; tag. The . says to add a “class” designation to the element, and byline is the class name we are applying. If we wanted to add an id= instead, it would be p#byline.\n\n\n\nEmmet wrap with class\n\n\nFor the last part of the byline here, you need to wrap the authors name with a link to his NYT profile.\n\nUse Emmet to create the a tag around “Eric Kim” and use the provided URL as the href.\n\n\n\n8.4.6 Live server\nYou will want to occasionally check to see how your code is displaying in a browser to make sure everything is working as expected. One way is to open the html file in Chrome (File &gt; Open File) and the refresh each time you want to see an update. But there is a better way: When we did our computer setup you should’ve installed a VS Code extension called “Live Server”.\n\nClick on the “Go Live” button at the bottom-right of VS Code\n\n\n\n\nStart live server\n\n\nThis will create a web server on your computer and then open the current file in your default browser. As you make changes to the HTML and save it, the page automagically updates in your browser.\nYour page should look something like this at this point:\n\n\n\nEarly look\n\n\nI suggest now get in the habit of saving your work after each section we work through here, and then check your live server to see how it looks.\n\n\n8.4.7 Description lists\nThis next bit of text we need to put together as a description list, which is a special list construct where you have a “term” and a “description”. Look at that this W3schools link to see how it works.\nThe description list is a little different because the list “items” come in two parts, the &lt;dt&gt; tag for the “term” and the &lt;dd&gt; tag for the “description” of the term. We can use Emmet to get us real close with the text we have, but we’ll need to do a little correction at the end.\nWith this Emmet command we’ll introduce child elements and multiplication. By using the Emmet shorthand dl&gt;dt* I’m saying “Wrap all of this with a &lt;dl&gt; tag, then inside of that (the &gt;) wrap the elements with &lt;dt&gt; tag, multiplying for all the items (the * part.)\nWatch what happens to the text as I add each part of the command. Note I don’t get exactly what I want since I can’t alternate the &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dl&gt; tags (or at least I don’t know how), so I fix those manually.\n\n\n\nEmmet description list\n\n\nNow you need to do the same with your code.\n\nUse the emmet syntax dl&gt;dt* to wrap create your description list.\nManually fix the descriptions to use &lt;dd&gt; tags.\n\nYour page should look like this when you are done.\n\n\n\nPage after description lists\n\n\n\n\n8.4.8 Images\nIn our text we have a caption for a photo, but not the photo itself. We need to download it.\n\nClick on the download link below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download this photo\n\n\n\n\nSave (or move) the photo into your project folder right next to recipe.html.\n\n\n8.4.8.1 About figures\nOne of your Codecademy lessons was about Semantic HTML, and we’ll apply some of that here. From our lessons, we know that the &lt;img src=\"\"&gt; tag can display an image, but to make this image accessible and useful to all users of the web, we need to add an alt= attribute to describe the image with words. It’s also best to wrap both the image and caption in a semantic &lt;figure&gt; tag so screen readers understand what that the image and caption go together.\nSo far, we’ve used Emmet to wrap existing code, but we can also write shell code using Emmet. In some cases we can tab through the written parts to fill in context.\nAgain, this might be helpful to see before you do it on your own. This is me adding the figure, img and figcaption tags we just talked about, and then filling the values. There is a lot of “tab” keying here you don’t see.\n\n\n\nCreate figure with Emmet\n\n\nOK, here are the steps for you:\n\nOn a blank line above the caption in your text, add the following Emmet syntax, then use tab to complete it.\n\nfigure&gt;img+figcaption\n\nUse your tag key to type in the path to the image, then the alt attribute as show in the gif above.\n\nThe new thing we added with that syntax is +, which says we want both an &lt;img&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tag inside the figure.\n\n\n\n8.4.9 Paragraphs\nOur next bit of text in our file is the recipe introduction, which is just text. We want to mark this up as paragraph and class the element as “intro”. You did this before with the byline.\n\nCode the intro with the Emmet syntax p.intro.\n\nIf you had multiple paragraphs, you could highlight all the text and use the shorthand p* to code each individual paragraph.\n\n\n8.4.10 Unordered lists\nOur ingredients list needs to coded where the headline is an H3 tag and the actual ingredients are in an unordered list.\n\nCode the “Ingredients” subhead as an H3\nUse the “Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation” command with the syntax ul&gt;li* to code the ingredients list.\nSoe the same for the “Nutrition” section further down the page.\n\n\n\n8.4.11 Ordered lists\nThe preparation steps are similar to the ingredients and nutrition, but the items need to be in an “ordered” list to show the step numbers.\n\nCode the “Preparation” subhead as an H3\nUse Wrap with Abbreviation on the steps, with ol&gt;li*\n\n\n\n8.4.12 Semantic blocks\nNow, if you check your live server again your page should look like the example shown at the beginning of this lesson, but we aren’t quite done yet.\nIn the Semantic HTML lesson you learned that we use some HTML tags to designate parts of pages so screen readers and other enabling software can understand our pages. We can also utilize those tags later when we style pages with CSS.\nWhile we don’t have a full website page here with navigation and such, I want you to mark up the parts of the pages that we do have:\n\nAdd an &lt;article&gt; tag that encapsulates everything within our &lt;body&gt; thus far. So it should start right after the opening &lt;body&gt; tag and close right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.\nAdd separate &lt;section&gt; tags around the Ingredients, Preparation and Nutrition sections. Each of those sections should be inside their own &lt;section&gt; tag.\nAdd a new &lt;footer&gt; tag and child &lt;p&gt; tag after the closing &lt;/article&gt; tag. Inside the paragraph tag, add the text “A class project by First Last” but with your name.",

Here is this page in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\nNotice the (admittedly subtle) difference in vertical spacing. The image starts in different places.\n\n\n\nBrowser example 1\n\n\nAnd a little further down the page, notice the difference in the size of the bullets and the line height between lines.\n\n\n\nBrowser example 2\n\n\n\n10.4.1 Add the reset file\nThere is way to deal with these differences. The concept – called a CSS Reset – is to zero out all margins, padding and text sizes so you have a zero base to work from before applying new styles. The version that we will use is from HTML5Doctor, and you can read about it here.\nSo, let’s do it:\n\nIn your yourname-html-css folder, create a new blank file called reset.css – you might use the touch command to do this, or File &gt; New File in VS Code – and then populate it with the contents of the HTML5resetCSS file.\nWe need to add a link in our HTML stylesheet to the reset CSS stylesheet. Put this before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag.\n\n(If you start typing “link” then Emmet will give you options, where you can choose link:css.)\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"reset.css\"&gt;\nThe link tag basically connects these files together. I’ll be honest … I never remember how to write it … I depend on Emmet or look it up.\nSave your page and look at you Live Server to watch your something-kinda-special web page turn into muck.\n\n\n\nPage after reset\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Relative font sizing\nIf you’ve worked with any HTML font sizing before, you might be familiar with setting the size of things in pixels, or px. When you use that type of measurement with fonts it makes it difficult to adjust them for different screen sizes, which is common with responsive design. (Responsive design is making web pages that work equally well on phones, tablet and desktops.)\nSo we’ll use a method to build upon our CSS reset that creates a base size for fonts, and then makes any further changes relative to that base size. There is more to it than that, but we’ll skip the why and discuss the how:\n\nWe’ll reset the browser default text size from 16px to 10px. We do this by using a percentage: 62.5% of the original 16px.\nNow every rem value we use is based on factors of 10 1rem is equal to 10px and 2.4rem is equal to 24px for a normally-sized browser.\n\n\n\n10.4.3 Create styles file, reset defaults\n\nCreate a new file and call it styles.css.\nNow, in your recipe.html file, add a new &lt;link&gt; tag referring to that css file after the reset.css link.\nNow we’ll add some defaults for the &lt;html&gt; tag in the styles.css file. Add this to the top, then save both the css and html files.\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n  font-size: 62.5%;\n}\nIf you check your live server you’ll see things got worse … everything is super small now. Don’t worry, we’ll fix it.\n\n\n10.4.4 Set text sizes\nLet’s fix up the text sizes. We’re going to set a base size for all basic text elements, and then change them later in the places where we need them. Add this to your styles file:\np, ul, ol, dl {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n  line-height: 1.8rem;\n  margin-bottom: 12px;\n}\nWhat this has done is set all text-type elements at what is the equivalent to 16px, but we’ve used the rem measurement to set it relative to the base size, which was essentially 10px.\nWe’ve set a line-height so lines of type don’t sit on top of each other and we’ve also given all of those elements a bottom margin so the elements have some space between them.\nIn the definition above, it’s important that we have commas between each HTML element. If we don’t have those, the browser will think we need all of them together (and) instead of any of them (or). We are setting these rules for p or ul or ol, etc. Not all of them used together.\n\n\n10.4.5 Set headline sizes\nNow we’ll set headlines font and sizes. Add this to your styles.css file, save and refresh your browser:\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  font-family: Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 2.7rem;\n  line-height: 3.1rem;\n  margin: 20px 0;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  line-height: 2.4rem;\n  margin: 16px 0;\n}\n\nh3 {\n  font-size: 1.75rem;\n  margin: 25px 0 8px 0;\n}\nThe first rule sets the font to a series of sans serif fonts, and we’ve done it for all headline sizes.\nThe other rules set sizes and margins for various sizes of headlines. You’ll notice that the margins are set in a single line. You can review the rules regarding that here.",

    "text": "10.6 Using class and id\nSo far, all of the styles we’ve created has been written to an “element” tag, like &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h3&gt;. But what if we want to style two different paragraphs differently?\nFor instance, on our page we have two &lt;p&gt; tags that serve different purposes: Our byline and our intro. We want them to look different. This is why we added class=\"byline\" and class=\"intro\" to those paragraphs.\nThere is a cascading hierarchy to styles (hence the term Cascading Style Sheets):\n\nHTML elements are the most generic thing you can style. A &lt;p&gt; tag or &lt;h1&gt;, etc. If you write a style for one, it affects ALL of those elements on your site. The style for a &lt;p&gt; tag is: p {selector: rule;}\nBut sometimes you have common elements that you re-use often, like byline. You always want those to look a certain way on your site, but you want them to look differently than you body text. So, you “classify” that element with a class attribute: class=\"byline\". Now that it is classified, we can write one style that will affect all the bylines. When we write a style for one of these classes we indicate that by preceding the class name with a period: .byline {font-family: Arial;}.\nThere are also instances when an element is used only one way on a page, so we can “identify” that element with an id attribute: id=\"unique-whatever\". An example on our page is our ingredients list; there is always only one of those on a page. When we use an id we are indicating to the browser (and our fellow coders, and even Google) that this element only appears once on this page. When we write a style for an id, we precede the name with a hash to indicate the style is for an id: #unique-whatever {font-family: Times;}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nAlways use lowercase characters in class names and use dashes if they have more than one word. Using a common convention to write code helps people collaborate because is predictable and more readable.\nName your classes for what the element is, not what you want it to look like. If you used the class name tahoma instead of byline and then decided later to change your byline font to be “Franklin Gothic”, that would be confusing.\n\n\n\n\n10.6.1 Setting style by class\nWe want our byline to be in a sans-serif font while we want our other paragraphs to maintain the default serif font, so let’s write a style to it.\nWe add a . before the style name to target it, so .byline.\n\nAdd the style below for the byline\n\n.byline {font-family: Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;}\nWe’ve changed the font from the default to Tahoma, with some backups in case a user doesn’t have that font.\nAbout font names … If you wanted to use Franklin Gothic as as a font it would need to be in quotes because it is multiple words: font-family: \"Franklin Gothic\", Arial, sans-serif;.\nWe will style to an id= attribute a little later in the assignment.\n\n\n10.6.2 Tricks of the trade\nWhen writing styles I’ll often use the browser Inspector to experiment with what they might look like on the screen. Once I figure out my style, I can then add it to my styles file.\nIt’s easier to show this than to write it out, but here are the steps:\n\nUse control-click on the element to get the contextual menu and choose Inspector.\nMake sure you are on the correct element in the Element tab of the Inspector.\nAdd/modify rules rules in the Styles tab of the Inspector.\n\nHere is a video example.\n\nI’ll drop a couple more tips as we go through the lesson.",

So, what do you think I did? I googled it, of course, using the phrase “make css dd dt on same line”. I got my answer here. It wasn’t the first answer of my Google search … I had to poke around on different search results until I found one that worked for me.\nBut what the answer does is introduce the float style for us, which is one of the ways we can position items on a page using CSS. We can use float to move our &lt;dt&gt; tags to the left of our &lt;dd&gt; tags so they are on the same line.\n\nAdd the following styles to your style sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry adding one rule at a time and saving your styles file so you can see what each one does in your live server. I really encourage you to type out the rules so you can see how VS Code helps you write.\n\n\ndt {\n  float: left;\n  margin-right: 5px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nThe first rule moves the &lt;dt&gt; elements to the left of any element that follows.\nThe second puts some margin on the right side of hat &lt;dt&gt; tag so it isn’t smooshed next to the &lt;dt&gt; element.\nThe last line makes the &lt;dt&gt; text bold.\n\nWe have just a bit more cleanup styling to do to adjust the type styles, margins and padding of the description list.\n\nEDIT your rules on the &lt;dl&gt; element to add each line below. Again, try adding them one at a time so you see what each rule does.\n\n  font-family: Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: 1.4rem;\n  padding: 12px 0px;\n  margin-top: 16px;\nNow your recipe stats should look like our example above.",

    "section": "10.9 Percentage widths",
    "text": "10.9 Percentage widths\nAnother tool to control the position of elements on an page is the width style, which we will use to divide our page based on the percentage of our page.\nIf you look at our finished example at the top of this lesson you’ll see that the photo and caption are sitting to the right of the headline, byline and such. We’ll use float to move the several elements to the left of the figure element, but we also need to regulate how wide all these things are so they fit in our story well.\nOne challenge is that our website will likely have LOTS of figures/photos, so we want to move just this one display as it relates to the main image in a recipe story. Since there is always only ONE main image for each recipe, we can use an id to target this and manipulate it.\nWe have to edit our HTML in a couple of ways so we can write styles to manipulate it.\n\nIn your recipe.html file, add a &lt;div id=\"head-section\"&gt; that starts before your &lt;h1&gt; tag and ends just before the &lt;figure&gt; tag.\nNext, find your &lt;figure&gt; tag and add the id called “main-recipe-photo”: &lt;figure id=\"main-recipe-photo\"&gt;. Save the HTML file.\nGo into your styles.css file and add the following rules:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAgain, try adding these three rules one at time so you see how each one affects the layout.\n\n\ndiv#head-section {\n  float: left;\n  width: 48%;\n}\n\nfigure#main-recipe-photo {\n  float: right;\n  width: 48%;\n}\n\nfigure#main-recipe-photo img {\n  width: 100%;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n}\nThis is a lot to break down.\n\nIn the &lt;div id=\"head-section&gt; tag we set the whole element (which includes the two headlines, byline and stats box) to float to the left and only take up 48% of the page. Note this style targets only divs with an id of “head-section”.\nThen we take the figure and float it to the right and make it only 48% the page. It moves it, but the photo is too big to fit in that space. Note we are targeting only figures with an id of “main-recipe-photo” so this would not affect other photos on the page.\nSo in the last rule we target images inside figures with an id of “main-recipe-photo” and set the width to be 100% of the available space, which is that 48% segment within the figure. We add a margin so it starts about even the main headline.\n\n\n10.9.1 Style our figcaption\nLet’s pretty up our figure caption. There is nothing new here, but we need to add a style for the figcaption element. We are setting this to the element because we want this style for all our captions across our page and website.\nfigcaption {\n  font-family: Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n  margin-top: 2px;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\nWe’re just setting font styles and giving a little space between stuff.\n\n\n10.9.2 Breaking a float\nWe’ve made progress, but we’re not quite there.\n\n\n\nAfter setting figure floats\n\n\nAs you can see here, the intro is creeping up under the photo, but we want it to go all the way across the page. It’s getting pulled there because of the floats on the elements above. We can fix this by adding a clear style on our intro text. The clear tag cancels out floats, and you can set it to clear left, right or both directions.\nWhen we coded our HTML file we had added a class called “intro” to that paragraph, so we will target that with this next rule:\n.intro {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n  clear: both;\n}\nThis pushes the intro down so it flows across the page. There is a little space under the photos, but that is OK because that main photo might not always be that shape.",

This is our goal:\n\n\n\nNutrition list example\n\n\nBefore we can apply styles to this unordered list, we need to identify it in some way so we don’t also make changes to the ingredients list. To do that, you’ll go in and add an to the &lt;section&gt; element:\n\nGo into your recipe.html page and find the semantic HTML tag &lt;section&gt; for the Nutrition section.\nEdit that tag to add id=\"nutrition\".\n\nOur nutrition list currently has a vertical structure. We could separate these items into two sections and float the two sections, but if they were generated from an application or CMS of some kind, we might not know when to separate the left section from the right.\nWhat we’ll do instead is use a combination of float and a special CSS selector called nth-child to adjust every other list item.\nLet’s do this in incremental steps so you can see the magic happen.\n\nSet the dotted border on the li tags with this:\n\n#nutrition li {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  border-bottom: grey dotted 1px;\n}\nSince we only want to change only the list items that are within the nutrition div, we used both the #nutrition id and the li element selectors.\n\nThe first rule we choose a “none” list style to remove the bullets\nThen we add the grey dotted line.\n\nNow let’s use some of the same techniques we used with the header and figure to get these side-by-side.\n\nEdit that style rule to add these two rules:\n\n  float: left;\n  width: 48%\nThat starts putting these side-by-side, but there is no gutter between them.\n\n\n\nList items floated\n\n\nNow the fun part … we need to apply styles to just every other list item (those that now fall into the left column). Our first challenge is to make sure we are targeting the right element. Another trick of the trade: I sometimes write a temporary style to an element, like turning the background red, just to make sure I’m getting the right thing. Let’s do that here.\n\nAdd this rule with the nth-child designation for “odd” elements.\n\n#nutrition li:nth-child(odd) {\n  background-color: red;\n}\nThis shows us that our style is getting the alternating rows:\n\n\n\nAlternating rows\n\n\nLet’s pause here to break down that rule of the nth-child. The nth-child rule lets us apply a style to a specific list item. Where we have used (odd) you could also put in a number, like (4) and it would apply to the fourth item in the list. Or (even). Try it!\nOK, now that we know we have targeted the right items, we can add styles to add a right margin to push those even numbered items over a bit. We’ll also add a clear to those so the footer won’t keep crawling up.\n\nEdit the style rule to add these lines:\n\n(Again, you might do them one at a time to see what they do.)\n  margin-right: 20px;\n\nAnd now you can remove the background-color rule.",

You can use the same one we used with the practice assignment, and you need to populate it with the contents of the HTMLDocter reset file.\nNow that you have a reset css file, you’ll need to create another separate css file for all your other styles (name it styles.css) and link it to your html file.\nSet the base (html) font as “Times New Roman” with acceptable backups. Reset the font-size for easier relative sizing by setting the body font size to 62.5%, which is the equivalent of 10px, like we did with the recipe.\nNow set a standard font size for text elements like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;dl&gt; tags. (Make the base font larger.) You’ll also want to set a bottom margin on those elements so they don’t run up against each other.\nAdd an &lt;article&gt; tag after the &lt;body&gt;tag in your HTML file if you need to, then in your CSS file make the max-width of the article 620px and center it.\nIn the HTML, set the width of the photo to 620px using a “width” attribute (you can put it after the src attribute).\nUse Google Fonts to find and use a font called “Ubuntu” and add that to your page. You can review the chapter Using Google Fonts for tips on how.\nSet all your headlines to use that Ubuntu font (with backups) and set headline sizes that make visual sense, but follow convention. (i.e., make sure h1 is the biggest and is used for the article headline.) Make sure you also include the &lt;h4&gt; label above the headline.\nSet the byline and photo credit lines to use the font Arial with an appropriate backup. Adjust sizes so they are visually appealing.\nUse a &lt;span&gt; tag around the date in the byline, and set it to font-style of italic. This page explains a span, but PLEASE don’t style the span directly like that. Write in the styles file instead.\nMake the photo credit text right-aligned and nudge up the margin so it sits close but not upon the photo so readers know that is what it goes with.\nFor the blockquote, set a solid left border that is grey and 4px thick. Add some padding (20px) between this border and the text, and some left margin (30px) to inset into the article.\nFor the ordered list style, the numbers should line up with the text in the article. list-style-position should help you with this.\nFor the “comment-notes” section, set a background-color of #CCC and give the content padding of 12px on all sides.\nOnce you are done with everything, push it to Github.\nTurn in the link to your repo.",

Include a README and .gitignore file.\nYou’ll need to create a new HTML file (call it js-practice.html) with the HTML5 boilerplate.\n\nLike CSS, you can write Javascript either in an HTML page, or in a separate file and link to it. We will be typing all our code within a &lt;script&gt; tag inside the body of our HTML page. Mark the answers for each question using JavaScript’s comment syntax. As you see below, there are two ways to write a JavaScript comment:\n&lt;script&gt;\n\n// This is a comment\nlet somecode = 'this code';\n\n/*\nFYI: this is a comment, too\nbut it can be on more then one line\n*/\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\nYou’ll test all of our code by opening this page with a browser window and then looking at the Inspector’s Console window. The Console is one way we can interact with JavaScript in a browser, and vise versa.\nTo get started:\n\nOnce you’ve created your js-practice.html file, add this code inside it:\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;JavaScript practice&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Your JavaScript page&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Use your Inspector to view your console.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    // Your code will go here\n\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nSave your file\nClick on the Go Live button to start your live server, which should open your js-practice.html page. It will be blank and that’s OK.\nRight-click (control-click on Mac) in the middle of the page and choose Inspector.\nWhen then Inspector loads, click on the Console tab.\nYou can close any other little windows that pop up.\n\n\n\n\njs-console\n\n\nOK, let’s start writing some javascript in the next chapter.",

(We’ll talk about let and what a variable is below.)\n\nlet x = 5;\nconsole.log(x);\n\nSave your html page, then refresh your browser and you should see your console update to include the “5” in the log.\n\nThe browser will act on all our code written in JavaScript, in the order that we write it. You don’t actually see it happen, unless there is some result for you to see. We are using console.log to see that result.\nWe could actually type those commands into the browser Console, but anything we do would not be saved when the browser is refreshed.\n\n13.2.1 var vs. let vs. const\nThink of variables as containers that hold information. Their purpose is to label and store data that can then be used in your program. By providing a variable with a descriptive name, our programs can be understood more clearly by others and our future selves.\nUntil recently, the way to create (or declare) a variable in JavaScript was to use var variableName. In 2015 with the update to ES6, let and const were introduced as better ways of declaring variables. While the old term var still workds, we should use these new terms.\nHere are the very simplified differences between these three ways of declaring a variable:\n\nIf you declare a variable with var, you can re-declare it later and in doing so you will change its value.\nIf you declare a variable with let, you can change its value later, but you can’t re-declare it. If you try, you will get an error. This is usually good, because it tells you the variable was already in use.\nIf you declare a variable with const, you can’t change its value or re-declare it later.\n\nNote that you can also declare a variable without using any of those by just assigning a value to term. x = 5. DON’T DO IT. It is not good practice, as you can overwrite global variables already in play, no matter where it is called. You can read more about calling variables in scope, but I don’t want to get bogged down with it here.\nIn our example above, we used let to declare a variable that we called “x”, and then we assigned that variable to the value “5”.\nWhen we used console.log to print log our variable “x” to the screen, it returned our value: 5.",

What if our user only gave us their middle initial? Then we would have returns like “Arthur C Clarke”.\nHow might we test if the middle name is an initial? And then what might we do if that test is true? If our middle name is only one character, then it would be an initial, right? And if we know it is an initial, then we can add a period to it.\nJavaScript strings have a special property called .length. We’ll learn more about properties (and methods) in our next chapter, but know that we can get the number of characters in a string by appending the .length property, so middleName.length will return the number of characters in middleName.\nWe’ll use this special property to test if our middle name has only one character, and then add a period if it does.\nWe’ll start by building our base function, then we’ll build on it to make it better.\nSo we’ve made yet another name machine like your last homework.

There are three types, in order of complexity:\n\nAn if statement allows us to perform an action if the test is true.\nAn else statement allows us to add an action if the test is false.\nAn else if statement allow us to perform a new test if the first if is false.\n\nThere is also switch, but we’re not going to cover that here.\n\n15.2.1 Make middle initial test\nTo figure out if our middleName object is a single letter we can test its .length property. We’ll use an if to do this test. Let’s talk about how those work in JavaScript. Written in one line, the logic works like this:\nif (perform the test) {do this if true}\n\nFor our (perform the test), we want to check if the length of middleName is one character.\nFor our {do this if true} we will just return true;, which will write the word “true” to the Console for how.\n\n\nUpdate your makeBetterName function to add the if statement below to your function and include the return false; after the if statement.\n\n// Make a name with middle initial\nfunction makeBetterName(firstName, middleName, lastName) {\n  if (middleName.length === 1) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  let fullName = firstName + \" \" + middleName + \" \" + lastName;\n  return fullName;\n}\nNote the test here: middleName.length === 1). We checking the length of middleName and testing if the value is “1”, which would indicate a middle initial. Note that we use three equal signs === to test for truthiness.\n\nSave your files and test in your browser to make sure you are getting Joan’s name or a true value for John’s “F”.\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Add period if true\nNow let’s update our true statement to fix our middle name. Here is conceptually what we need to do: If our middleNameis one character, then add a period to the end.\nIf your middleName is one character we can use string concatenation reset the middleName to itself plus the period. Because middleName is an argument for our function, it is already instantiated as a variable, and it is only available inside this function. So, we can just modify it and then return the value out of the function.\n\nIn the if part of the function, replace the return true with a line that modifies the middleName variable to add the period. Code is shown below.\nUpdate the return statement to return middleName.\nSave and refresh your browser to check it. You should be getting back the middle initial and period if true, and “false” if false.\n\n// Make a name with middle initial\nfunction makeBetterName(firstName, middleName, lastName) {\n  if (middleName.length === 1) {\n    // adding and updating here\n    middleName = middleName + \".\";\n  }\n  let fullName = firstName + \" \" + middleName + \" \" + lastName;\n  return fullName;\n}\n\nAdd another console.log with another name that uses a middle initial and make sure that works, too.",

We created a function that squared two numbers. You (hopefully) created a function that puts parts of a name together.\nNow I want to introduce a new, important concept JavaScript called Objects which are also variables, but they can have more than one value, called properties. I would say these properties describe the object. If our object were a person, it might have these properties:\nJavaScript Objects can also have methods, which are things you can do to or with the object. Methods are “simply” functions embedded in the object. In this example, we have a fullName method within our “person” object.\nTo access a property of a JavaScript object, we follow the object with . and the name of the property: person.firstName gives us “Christian”.\nTo use a method of a JavaScript object we also follow the object with a . and the method name, but we have to follow the method with parenthesis: person.fullName() would give us “Christian McDonald”.\nThanks to something called the Document Object Model (or DOM, for short) JavaScript considers every HTML element on a web page a JavaScript Object and it has some baked-in properties and methods. (The properties and methods vary based on object type: string vs number vs date, etc.) This means we can access the properties of each HTML element and we can act on them through methods.\nWe’ll use these baked-in properties and methods in our next lesson.\nWe’ll use a method to find specific objects on the page to discover it’s properties. We’ll then make decisions based on those properties and then use another method to change that HTML object.",

Once we “have” that object, we can find its various properties, like how long it is, or the contents of the tag, etc.\nThe easiest way to do this is with document.getElementByID(\"id_name_here\"). Once we “have” the element, we can access its properties and methods. Using this, we can “get” the contents of the forms and put them into variables in our function.\n\n\nIn our makeBetterName() function, remove the three arguments inside the parenthesis.\nAdd the following three lines inside the function before the IF in your makeBetterName function:\n\nlet fName = document.getElementById(\"nameForm\").first.value;\nlet mName = document.getElementById(\"nameForm\").middle.value;\nlet lName = document.getElementById(\"nameForm\").last.value;\nWhat we are doing here is instead of feeding our names into the function through arguments, we are using document.getElementByID to find and get the “nameForm” element, and then we are accessing each input by its “name” property (i.e. .first). The property .value gives us the text of that is inside that input.\n\nNow, after the function, add a console.log that calls the function, but don’t feed it names like we did before:\n\nconsole.log(makeBetterName());\nYou should be able to save your file, refresh your browser and see King Aragorn’s name in the Console.\nOK, we’ve solved our first challenge of pulling the names from our fields. Now let’s update our &lt;h3 id=\"nameHead\"&gt; from our function.\n\n\n17.5.2 innerHTML\nWe can not only pluck the value of a field with getElementByID, but we can also change existing text by using the .innerHTML property.\n\nIn our function, replace the line return fullName; with this:\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"nameHead\").innerHTML = fullName;\n\nSave your file and refresh yor page, and now the &lt;h3&gt; tag (which has id=\"nameHead\") that used to say “Name will go here” should now have our default form text: “Aragorn Elessar Telcontar”.\n\nThis new line of code uses the same DOM method getElementByID to identify the HTML element we wanted, but this time we used the .innterHMTL property to shove content into it. What content was that? It’s the contents of the fullName which now comes from our text boxes on the page.\n\n\n17.5.3 Hooking up the button\nOur function is working like we want, but it’s being called each time we refresh the page, and not when we click the button, so let’s fix that. We do so by removing our console.log, and then adding an “onclick” attribute to our button.\n\nRemove the console.log(makeBetterName()) line that we added earlier to test the function.\nIn form in the HTML body, update the input button to the following:\n\n&lt;input type=\"button\" value=\"Make name\" onclick=\"makeBetterName()\"&gt;\nWhat we’ve done here is used the onclick Event to add interactivity to our button. Until now it was just an element on the page that didn’t do anything, but now when we click on the button it fires the makeBetterName function, which uses our “name machine” to insert our text inside the &lt;h3&gt; we’ve specified through its id.\n\nSave your file and refresh the page.\nClick the “Make name” button and it should update the &lt;h3&gt; tag.\nPut your own names into the text boxes and hit the button and it should change the headline.\nMake sure it still works with a middle initial.",

If at any point you get an error in your Console, stop before moving on to the next step. Each step is dependent on the step before.\n\n19.3.1 v1: “Zero configuration”\n\nCreate a new file in your javascript-practice project folder called datatable.html and add the basic HTML5 boilerplate using Emmet.\nGo to the DataTables home page and click the link for “Examples”.\nOn the Examples page, choose the “Zero configuration” example under “Basic initialisation”.\nOn the page with the example you’ll see tabs below the table for “JavaScript”, “HTML” and “CSS” with the code you need. However, there are some assumptions in the instructions, so listen up:\n\nStart with the HTML tab and copy the code in the box. Take the contents of that box and put it in your datatable.html HTML page between the &lt;body&gt; tags. Save the file and go look at your page in a browser, so you will see how it changes.\nGo back to the JavaScript tab on the DataTables site. The contents of that box should go inside a &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag at the bottom of your datatable.html HTML page before the close of the &lt;/body&gt; tag.\n\n\nThe parts of this exercise to add the Datatables JavaScript and CSS files assumes some knowledge and is not explained well in the directions. Do this instead:\n\nCopy the three links below and add them to the bottom of your &lt;head&gt; tag just before the closing &lt;/head&gt;.\n\n&lt;script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"https://cdn.datatables.net/1.13.5/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.datatables.net/1.13.5/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css\"&gt;\n\nSave your page and look at it in your browser. You should have a working table.\n\n\n\n19.3.2 Recap of how this works\n\nIn our &lt;head&gt; tag we have links to the JQuery JavaScript plugin, the Datatables-specific Javascript files and the Datatables CSS to make it look pretty.\nIn the &lt;body&gt; tag you have your HTML table.\nAt the bottom you have a &lt;script&gt; tag that tells the page to apply the Datatables javascript to our specific table (based on the id of the table.)\n\n\n\n19.3.3 v2: “Scroll Vertical”\n\nCreate a copy of the HTML file you created above and call it scrolling.html.\nGo to the “Scroll Vertical” example. Replace your JavaScript in your\n\ntags in the new HTML file you just created (scrolling.html) with the JavaScript on the “Scroll Vertical” example page.\nYou should now have a table that isn’t paginated and instead can be scrolled through, just like the example on the DataTables website.",

We work with the files in the src directory as there are background processes that run on those files, do cool stuff, and then compile the result into our publishing directory, in our case docs/.\nThe docs folder ends up being the “root” or base level of our site. All other files in the project need to need to be referenced relative to where they end up inside docs.\n\nAny .html file in src/ gets moved to a similar place in docs/.\nSass files in the src/scss/ folder get compiled/rewritten into the docs/css/ folder. There are two important implications of this:\n\nWhile the file name you edit ends in .scss, the compiled file in docs/css/ a .css extension.\nThis means your HTML files that end up at the root of docs will need to link to a compiled css file of the same name, but inside the css folder and with a .css extension, like href=\"css/filename.css\".\n\nFiles in the src/img/ folder are moved into docs/img/. Since your index.html file ends up in docs, then your img link needs to be img src=\"img/filename.jpg\".\n\n\n20.2.1 Configurations files\nThe remaining files and folders in the root folder are part of the development ecosystem. We don’t mess with this files much in our lessons, but here is a description of what they do:\n\n.gitignore tells Git which files to ignore sending to Github.\nREADME.md describes what the repo is about. It has our installation instructions.\n.gulpfile.js is the file that controls our task manager. This is where we tell the Gulp program where to find our Sass SCSS files and then where to place the compiled new CSS files. We won’t edit this file, but know it is necessary.\nThe files inside tasks are the workhorse of Gulp. Like the gulpfile, we won’t get into how they work. Just know this is the guts of the development ecosystem.\npackage.json is the file that tells the Node.js ecosystem which packages to download from npm. It is pre-configured for you.\npackage-lock.json is created by the npm install command based on the package.json file. It contains a bunch of details about dependencies that we don’t need to worry much about. Again, it is created by npm.\nA node_modules folder is generated from package.json when you run $ npm install. It will contain all the mini-programs, and it SHOULD NOT be pushed to Github ’cause it is huge. It’s been excluded in the .gitignore file.",

So, our goals for this project assignment are to:\nIf you don’t already have your project open in VS Code, go ahead and open it. Run $ gulp dev in your terminal to start the development environment.\nWhen the browser starts up, you’ll have a working multi-page website that uses traditional CSS. We are going to improve this code – or “refactor” it, as developers call it. It is a very common practice to go through old code and make it mo betta.",

    "text": "21.3 Variables\nOne of the most useful features of Sass is to define variables for certain CSS values. Once you start using the Sass variables in your code, you can then change the definition of the variable in one place instead of many throughout the code base. This makes it easy to support or change themes and make wholesale changes throughout your website.\nYou create variable names with a preceding dollar sign and then define its value like a CSS rule. When you want to use that variable’s value, use that variable name (with the $) as the CSS rule. As a matter of convention, we set all the variables at the top of our CSS files so they can be found easily.\nHere is an example:\n// set the variable\n$dark-border: 3px solid black;\n\n// use the variable\n.bigbox {\n  border: $dark-border;\n}\n\nblockquote {\n  // using the variable again\n  border-left: $dark-border;\n  padding-left: 20px;\n}\nNow, if we wanted to change our dark borders from 3px black lines to 5px grey lines, we would do it ONCE when we set the $dark-border variable at the top of the file, and it would change the value throughout the site.\n\n21.3.1 Variables exercise\nThere are two colors defined in our styles for our Harvey Dale and the Cements band website. Let’s Sassify them.\n\nCreate two new variables at the top of your src/scss/new-styles.scss file called $primary-color and $secondary-color and define their values from what is currently in the CSS.\nIn your CSS rules, replace the color values with the new variable names.\nSave and check your page. There should be no difference.\nChange your $primary-color variable value to a new color, like “red”, and see if what happens.\n\nYou should see your background color change on both the “home” page and the “shows” page. Be sure to check both of them.\n\n21.3.1.1 Troubleshooting\nIf you don’t see a change, there are a couple of things to check:\n\nMake sure that your gulp dev task is running in your Terminal so your Sass is getting compiled. If that is crashed with an error, you might try to Control-c in your Terminal to clear it.\n\nYou can try gulp dev again, but you probably have to fix the error first. Read the error output for clues and line number references. Also look in your VS Code new-styles.css files for red error indicators that say something is wrong codes.\n\nIf Sass is still compiling but you still don’t see a change, make sure your index.html and shows.html files are pointing to the correct new-styles.css file and that those pages have been saved.\nUnlikelyy to help, bu you can try holding down your Shift key while also refreshing your browser to clear the browser cache for that page.",

    "section": "21.4 Nesting",
    "text": "21.4 Nesting\nHTML code often has a clearly-nested hierarchy, where items like headlines are a child of the parent div they are inside.\nCSS doesn’t have the same hierarchy. If we want to target a style to an &lt;h3&gt; that is inside of a &lt;div&gt; with a specific id, we have to specify both the div id and the headline in our rule. Perhaps not a big deal for one headline, but wasteful when you want to target a bunch of different items inside that div.\nSass allows us to write this as a visual hierarchy that is both easier to understand and often (but not always) in fewer lines of code.\nWhile this is useful, we do need to be careful not to nest too much (three levels?) or our CSS will end up over-qualified and bloated. In addition, we don’t want to completely mimic our html hierarchy because then small changes in the HTML might break our styles.\nHere is an example of traditional CSS where the styles for the ul and li tags will only be applied if they are inside a &lt;nav&gt; element.\nnav ul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nnav li {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\nHere is an example of how you would write this in SCSS using hierarchy:\nnav {\n  ul {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    list-style: none;\n  }\n  li {\n    display: inline-block;\n  }\n}\nWritten in our Sassy way, we can immediately understand that the ul and li rules apply only to the nav element. It’s easier to understand and maintain.\n\n21.4.1 Nesting exercise\nOpen your index.html file and look at the structure of our HTML. We can see there is a &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt; that is the parent to all of what is contained in the body. There are two other div elements, &lt;div class=\"nav\"&gt; and &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt; that are nested inside the container.\nIf you look through the CSS you copied into new-styles.scss, you’ll see there are a number of rules that include the .content class. This is an opportunity to nest this series of rules. Let’s refactor our SCSS to reflect this nesting so it is more understandable.\nWe’ll combine the first two, and then you can do the rest on your own. We are starting with this:\n.content {\n  width: 85%;\n  min-height: 750px;\n  min-width: 600px;\n  background-color: $primary-color;\n}\n\n.content ul {\n  padding-left: 30px;\n}\nWe want to the .content ul rule to be nested inside the .content rule above it, after the rules that are already there. When we do that refactor, we need to remove what would be an extra .content selector before the ul.\n\nEdit your .scss file to nest .content ul inside the .content rule. It should look like this, including indentation:\n\n.content {\n  width: 85%;\n  min-height: 750px;\n  min-width: 600px;\n  background-color: $primary-color;\n\n  ul {\n    padding-left: 30px;\n  }\n}\n\n\n21.4.2 On your own\n\nAfter you making the change above, make sure the styles are still building correctly and nothing broke on your page.\nRefactor the rest of the .content rules to fit like we did the one above.\nAgain, make sure nothing is broken on the page display.\n\n\n\n21.4.3 Any children rule\nLet’s pause and reflect. Do you notice any value that repeats itself over and over again inside of .content? If you look closely you will see that padding-left: 30px is an attribute of every direct child of .content. In some cases it is the only rule for that style.\nThis rule was added so that all the items inside &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt; would have some space between the nav block and the content. It’s not a particularly great way to handle this as you have to create a new rule for every possible element you might add into the content div on your page.\nThere’s a shorthand CSS selector for applying a property to all “child” elements, the &gt; * {rule;}. Using this, we can set the padding rule to be applied to anything inside the .content div. Let’s use this to set padding and clean up all the extra rules that do the same thing.\n\nInside the .content rule, before the other nested rules, add this one. Make sure it is indented properly like other nested rules:\n &gt; * {\n   padding-left: 30px;\n }\nNow that you’ve done this you can remove all the other padding-left: 30px; everywhere else. In some cases, you no longer even need the style at all for that element because the padding was the only rule.",

    "text": "21.5 Partials\nYou may have noticed when we started this project that there was a separate reset.css file like we had in our CSS lesson, and that both are included in the &lt;head&gt; of our HTML files. It’s generally poor practice to make multiple links to multiple files if you can avoid it. It takes time (though milliseconds) each time you have to retrieve a new file from a server. It’s best to bundle all your CSS together in one file to the browser doesn’t have to make multiple trips.\nThat’s great, but that can make for some really long CSS files that are hard to manage. Sass allows for a concept called partials that allow us to break out SCSS files into smaller chunks to we can better organize it. Many developers will break up their code based on the part of the page or the function the code supports.\nSass partial filenames should start with an underscore, like _nav.scss, so Sass can know that it will be “used” and not create a new compiled .css file.\n\n21.5.1 Making the reset a partial\nTogether, we’ll modify the reset.css file and make it into a Sass partial.\nWe first need to change the name of the file so it starts with an underscore _ and ends in .scss so Sass can deal with it properly.\n\nIn your Explorer list find the file reset.css file (it’s in src/scss/) and rename it to _reset.scss.\nGo into the new-styles.scss file and at the top of the file but below your color variables, add the following:\n@import 'reset';\nNote that you don’t need to include the underscore or the file extension to the import call, as Sass will understand that automatically. (Though I don’t think it would break if you had them.)\nNow go into both index.html and shows.html and remove the line of code that links to the old reset file.\nMake sure that your Gulp process is still working and your page is still working OK.\n\n\n\n21.5.2 Partials practice\nOK, so that you’ve seen how that works, I want you to create three new partials to divide your scss files: base, nav and content.\n\nInside the /src/scss folder, create a three new files:\n\n_base.scss\n_nav.scss\n_content.scss\n\nWe’ll leave our variables in new-styles.scss, so they continue to apply to all the other code that follows.\nGo into new-styles.scss and copy/cut all the lines generic rules that apply to the whole site … i.e. those not in the .nav and .content. Add those lines to _base.scss.\nGo into new-styles.scss and copy/cut all the lines for the .nav calls and add them to _nav.scss.\nDo the same for all the .content calls into the _content.scss file.\nLastly, after your variable rules, add @import calls into new-styles.scss for our new partials AFTER the import for reset.\n@import 'base';\n\nRemember that you don’t need to add the underscore or the .scss with these import designations, as Sass assumes them already.\nMake sure these @imports come AFTER your variables, because this CSS still cascades, and the variables are used by the imports.",

Before driving yourself too crazy if a change isn’t happening, try holding down the shift key and refresh your browser. This forces the browser to reload linked files instead of caching them.\n\n\n\n21.6.1 Text sizes\n\nIncrease the size of all paragraphs and lists that are in the content div without affecting the size of items in the nav div. (Headlines should remain larger than 1rem.)\nAlso set a line-height rule within those same paragraphs to give some space between lines of text.\nAdd a comment in the sass file above the lines where you make these changes so I can find them!\n\n\n\n21.6.2 Remove the bullets in the nav\nYou’ll see in the image below that there are list item bullets in the navigation and in on the Shows page that list the show. We don’t want those bullets in the navigation.\n\nWrite a style that removes the bullets for the list in the navigation section, while retaining the bullets on the shows page.\n\n\n\n\nNavigation bullets\n\n\n\n\n21.6.3 Set bullet style for shows\nThe list of shows on the shows.html is hard to read. Make some changes to make it look better:\n\n\n\nGood bullet list\n\n\n\nMake the list of shows a bulleted list. (Style of your choice.)\nMake sure the bullets line up vertically with the video on the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure you don’t add bullets back to the list items in the nav!\n\n\n\n\n21.6.4 Set anchor underlines\nAdd styles that will give navigation links the primary color and behave like those in the body, where the underline only shows on hover.\n\n\n\nHover lines in navigation\n\n\nSelecting these are a bit tricky. link, hover, visited are all separate properties and each one needs to be specified individually with a text-decoration property, like this:\na:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\nYou’ll want to set these styles in the _nav.scss file.\n\nSet both the link and visited values to have the primary color, and the text-decoration to none.\nSet hover color to the primary color, and text-decoration to underline.\n\nRemember, you want these styles to only apply in the navigation.\n\n\n21.6.5 Content link colors\nIn the “content” parts of pages, I want hrefs to have the underline, and that the color of the links be something other than the browser default blue/purple color. Choose a color that makes sense given the primary color you use (which might be your secondary color).",

    "section": "21.7 File names and paths",
    "text": "21.7 File names and paths\nThis is the first project where we have had multiple pages, so let’s talk a bit about file names and paths between files.\nYou might have noticed that when we ran gulp dev and our browser launched it displayed the page called index.html. That is a special file name in the web world … it is the HTML page that will display from a directory if no other path is specified. So, anytime you go to a website that where the url ends at the domain or a /, like statesman.com/, then what you are seeing is the index.html page. (OK, it can be more complicated than that, but generally true.)\nSo, the index is the “home page” of a directory.\nTake a look at the docs folder in your VS Code Explorer.\n\n\n\nDocs folder structure\n\n\nIt is this folder where all our processed pages are sent to … it is our “real” website, even though we edit from the src folder. It is the “root” of our site and where our index.html page lives. Everything else is relative to that folder. When we launch our environment, it goes to http://localhost:3000/ but it displays the index.html page. Once you click through to the shows.html page, it url changes to http://localhost:3000/shows.html. If you click on the Home link it takes you to http://localhost:3000/index.html, which is the same exact page as http://localhost:3000/.\nIf you look inside index.html in the nav element you’ll see this:\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"shows.html\"&gt;Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\nThis link is going to the shows.html page, which is right next to index.html. There are no folders or anything that the path has to traverse … it just names the file because they are adjacent to each other in the file structure.\nBut look a little further into the page and you’ll see this:\n  &lt;img src=\"img/harvey-dale.jpg\"/&gt;\nIf you look at our docs folder structure above, you’ll see that the harvey-dale.jpg photo is inside a folder called img. Because of this our src= path has to include that folder name in the path. This path is relative to where the index.html page lives.\nWe have img/ and css/ folders. The folders are there just for organization … those files could technically live anywhere within docs if paths are written correctly, but that would be messy. Again, it’s pretty common to store files of the same time like images the same directory.\nIt’s just important to remember the relative path between files in src/ should be the same as in docs/.\n\n21.7.1 Create a new page, update nav\nTo make sure you have an understanding about how files work together, I want you to create a new HTML page that will have “bios” for this trio in Harvey Dale and the Cements:\n\nCreate a single new html page that will publish next to index.html and shows.html. You can choose the filename (though it should make sense). You can use a copy of one of the existing pages to get started.\nChange the main headline of the new page to reflect the new content.\nAdd an h3 headline and a fake text paragraph for each of three members in the content section. The content doesn’t matter as much to me as using good coding techniques.\nUpdate the navigation on all the pages so they all work together.",

All the files in docs/ get regenerated when you are running gulp dev.\n\n\nMost web apps like this will use a folder called dist/ or public/ for their published files, but we are using docs/ to take advantage of some free web serving services offered by Github.\nInside our docs folder, you will eventually see the following:\n\nA css/ folder with all our compiled css. We won’t edit these files, because we will be using Sass and editing from the src/scss/ folder.\nA js/ folder. There are some Node.js server tasks that will copy files here for us.\nAn index.html file. This is the HTML page we will be building, but we will will be editing it from the src/ folder.\n\n\n\n23.4.2 The src folder\nThis is where we edit our files. Any change we make here gets compiled or copied into the docs/ folder by our Node.js server.\n\nOur .html files sit loose in the src/ folder (or put into subfolders). These get copied into docs/ in the same relative location.\nThe img folder is for our original image files. They get “minified” and placed in docs/img/.\nThe scss folder has styles.scss file were we will add all our Sassy css.\n\nWhen we run gulp dev we also launch a live server that will rebuild our project when we save our source files.\n\n23.4.2.1 Inspect the html file\nWhile we are in our src folder, let’s look at our HTML.\n\nOpen src/index.html and take a look at it.\n\nThere are several things going on here with this file beyond the base HTML. In the &lt;head&gt; we are pulling in css file that will be generated through Sass, including for the Bootstrap framework. At the bottom we are pulling in the JavaScript file that we need for Bootstrap, which will also be copied there by our development environment.\n\n\n23.4.2.2 Inspect the scss file\n\nOpen the src/scss/styles.scss file\n\nYou’ll see a lot of comments in this file to explain some things. There is an @import command here that pulls in all the Bootstrap css from our node_modules folder that we downloaded when we ran npm install. You don’t see the result yet on our index page, but you will soon. There are also some comments to guide you.\n\n\n\n23.4.3 Inspect the configuration files\nThe remaining files in the root level of the project are configuration files that help make this development ecosystem run.\n\nThe .gitignore file. It’s configured for a Node.js based web app.\nThe README.md file explains how to get started with this template.\nThe gulpfile.js is our magic task runner. More on that below.\nThe package.json and package-lock.json files keep track of all the npm packages we are using. When you run $ npm install, it downloads all the software into the node_modules folder, which is NOT saved into Github because it contains thousands of files.\n\n\n23.4.3.1 More about the gulpfile\nGulp is our task runner that creates our server, compiles our CSS and copies files where we need them. The gulpfile.js is the main controller file works works with a series of files in the tasks folder.\nEach task file does a single thing, like clean out folders, copy files to different directories, or run the Sass CSS compiler. Each task uses one or more node packages to do its work, and the names of the file indicates more or less what that is. We might review some of these in class and you are free to poke around there, but I’d be careful in editing these files at this point.\nThis setup gives us the two commands that we will use the most:\n\ngulp will compile our CSS and copy all our files into the docs/ folder.\ngulp dev will do all of the above, plus start our web server so we can see our page.\n\nI can tell you I did not write all this JavaScript. I found examples on the web that were close to what I needed and I used those, along with documentation, to configure them for my needs.",

Make your indents so your code is nice and pretty and shows properly the parent-child relationships of items. You’ll thank me later when you are trying to figure out what goes with what. That, and it is part of your grade, because I want to build good habits.\n\n\n\n24.1.1 Adjust the navbar color\nThere are a bajillion ways to customize both navs (the links) and navbars (the container). We’ll explore the docs just a bit more to change some colors and set up themeing for later.\n\nScroll a little further through the navbar docs and you’ll get to a section about color schemes. Study how they work. We are going for this second one listed with the blue background.\nChange the navbar style bg-body-tertiary to bg-primary. This changes the backgroud of the navbar to blue.\nAdd the attribute data-bs-theme=\"dark\" after the class, as shown in the example. This changes the text of the navbar to a light color to work against the darker background.\nSave and check your page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are glossing over that data-bs-theme=\"dark\" attribute a bit, but this is a new option in Bootstrap that allows you to create a “dark mode” for your website, including a toggle to switch back and forth with “light mode”. We won’t get into that here, but you can explore the documentation if you are interested.\n\n\n\n\n24.1.2 Review how nav works on mobile\nThis navbar code includes CSS and JavaScript that collapse links into a menu. By adding the navbar-expand-lg class here we control when those links expand to show across the page. Since that menu and the link dropdowns take JavaScript to work properly, testing those features is a good way to make sure Bootstrap is set up properly.\n\nUse your DevTools Inspector or change your window width to mobile to see the menu button.\nClick on it to make sure it works!\n\n\n\n\nTest your mobile navbar\n\n\nYou should look over the other code within the navs, especially the list items classed as nav-item and the a tags within them classed as nav-link. These are your actual links. Where they have href=\"#\" you’ll update # to the path to your HTML pages.\nI also want to point out here in the example the Home nav-link, which has two important classes because it represents the “Current” page on the site.\n\nThe class active here makes that item bold in the navigation bar to give the reader a visual clue you that you are viewing that specific page from the navigation menu.\nThe attribute aria-current=\"page\" denotes to screen readers this is the active link and is important for those who can’t “see” the visual clue that the active class gives us.\n\nWhen building web sites, you should update page navigation to reflect both of those for each pages.",

    "title": "24  Components",
    "section": "24.2 A Jumbotron site header",
    "text": "24.2 A Jumbotron site header\nOnce upon a time (like 2021) Bootstrap had a special header component called a Jumbotron. With Bootstrap 5’s release in May 2021 they got rid of it because you can build a similar display with their existing utility classes, which allows us to introduce Bootstrap examples along with content and utilites classes.\nFirst let’s take a look at what we are talking about.\n\nGo to the Bootstrap Examples page. You can get this from any Bootstrap Docs page in the navigation item called Examples.\n\nNow, these examples aren’t quite as easy to use as the Component documentation. To see how they work you have to either download the examples (which gets you all of them) or view the source code of each page (In Chrome, View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source.)\nInstead, we are just going to build this bit-by-bit. But I did want you to see the examples so you know our goal.\n\nAfter your nav, add a new div with a class=\"container\".\nInside that a semantic &lt;header&gt; element.\nInside the header add an h1 tag and a p tag and put some text in both. You can use VS Code lorem or maybe try a little cheese ipsum.\n\nIt should be something like this:\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Header headline is here&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Danish fontina when the cheese comes out everybody's happy ricotta. Gouda red leicester parmesan cottage cheese everyone loves monterey jack who moved my cheese cut the cheese.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nLet’s talk about that container. In Bootstrap, the class “container” applies some margins and centers content in the browser. It’s an important building block with responsive design because those margins expand/contract depending on your device width.\nThe rest of that:\n\nWe use the semantic &lt;header&gt; tag so it describes this part of the page. We can target that element with CSS.\nThe h1 and p tags are standard. For now. We’re about to gussy ’em up.\n\nWe will be doing a tour of Bootstrap content and utilites class as we go along.\n\n24.2.1 Typography classes\nLet’s gander at Bootstrap’s Typography documentation. These are a set of classes that can be applied to elements that give them a certain look. Because Bootstrap is customizable, it is possible to set these classes and then update them later with Sass. We’re going to stick with default styles for now.\n\nLook through the Display headings section to see how to apply the display-4 class and add that to your h1 within your header.\nLook at the Lead section and then add that class to your p tag within the header.\n\nYour code should look like this:\n  &lt;h1 class=\"display-4\"&gt;Header headline is here&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"lead\"&gt;Danish fontina when the cheese comes out everybody's happy ricotta. Gouda red leicester parmesan cottage cheese everyone loves monterey jack who moved my cheese cut the cheese.&lt;/p&gt;\nAnd your page should should be looking something like this:\n\n\n\nTypography classes\n\n\n\n\n24.2.2 Backgrounds\nWe’re going to add some color to our Jumbotron-like header using a background color. The Background classes are found in the Utilities part of the documentation.\n\nBrowse through the Backgrounds docs so you can see how they are used.\nOn the header div, add the class attribute to make the background our “secondary” color (the default whis is a dark gray color).\n\n&lt;header class=\"bg-secondary\"&gt;\nThat should yield a result like this:\n\n\n\nBackground color added\n\n\nStill ugly, but we are getting there.\n\n\n24.2.3 Colors\nNext on the tour are utility classes to control text colors.\n\nLook through the color documentation and figure out how to make white text.\nAdd that class to the same div that you added the background color, so it look like this:\n\n&lt;header class=\"bg-secondary text-white\"&gt;\nStill ugly, but you should have white text on the dark gray background.\n\n\n24.2.4 Spacing classes\nNext we’ll give our text some room to breathe using utility classes to control spacing between elements like margins and padding.\n\nGo to the Spacing documentation and look it over, especially the notation section.\n\nBasically this shorthand to build space around items (margin) and inside items (padding). While I can’t explain it better than they have, here is an abbreviated version of the shorthand:\n\nYou use m for margin or p for padding.\nFollowing m or p you add either: t (top), b (bottom), l (left), r (right), x (left and right), y (top and bottom), or nothing for all 4 sides.\nThen, you specify sizes with a hyphen and a value of 0 through 5 (5 being the largest amount of spacing).\n\nSo, pt-4 would be padding on the top at a value of 4.\nWe’ll use this on our header. Let’s add the code first then I’ll explain.\n\nAdd these as a class=\"\" to the header element (If you do this one at a time you can see what each does):\n\nmy-4 adds a margin to top and bottom of the element, basically moving it off the navigation.\np-5 adds padding, the space “inside” the element between the border and the text.\n\n\nYour header should look like this now:\n&lt;header class=\"bg-secondary text-white my-4 p-5\"&gt;\n\n\n24.2.5 Borders\nYou set the color, width, style and radius of borders with various border classes. Let’s use those to add a slight radius to our header corners.\n\nReview the border-radius docs and add the class to your header to make the corners of the box rounded. It’s a pretty slight visual change.\n\n\n\n24.2.6 Button component\nHere we’ll dive back into the components section of the docs to get a button to add to our Jumbotron-like header. But let’s use the Search docs to find it.\n\nGo to any page in the Bootstrap docs.\nIn the search bar at top left, type in “button”. As you do, you’ll see options pop up under the search. Choose the “Buttons / Buttons” option to get to the main Buttons page.\nIf your browser window is set wide enough, you should see an additional “On this page” navigation on the right side. Click on the Sizes link there. If you don’t have that navigation, just scroll down the page until you find Sizes.\nIn the Large button example, copy the first line that has btn-primary as part of the classes.\nAdd this code on a new line after the closing p tag in the header.\n\nWith this, we have our “Jumbotron”-like header. At this point, you page should be looking like this:\n\n\n\nButton added\n\n\nAnd your header code should look like this:\n&lt;header class=\"bg-secondary text-white my-4 p-5 rounded\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1 class=\"display-4\"&gt;Header headline is here&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"lead\"&gt;Danish fontina when the cheese comes out everybody's happy ricotta. Gouda red leicester parmesan cottage cheese everyone loves monterey jack who moved my cheese cut the cheese.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\"&gt;Large button&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\nThis might be a good time to use the git cycle to save and push your efforts to Github.",

    "text": "25.1.1 The sizes\nThere are five “breakpoints” for Bootstrap, meaning changes can happen at 5 different widths: default (extra small), sm, md, lg, xl and xxl. They kinda work out like this:\n\nthe default col is for a vertical phone\nsm is for a horizontal phone to a vertical tablet\nmd is for a horizontal tablet to laptop\nlg is for a laptop to desktop screen\nxl is for a large desktop screen\nxxl is for an even wider desktop screens\n\nEvery phone and computer screen is different, so that list above is approximate. (There are actual pixel widths set deep within the Bootstrap code and they are adjustable, but we aren’t going there.)\nLooking back at our three columns, we would want content like that to stack on top of each other at extra small browser widths, like on a phone. We can adjust our code to do this.\n\nChange all the col classes to instead be col-sm.\nAdjust your browser width and watch how the columns change.\n\nNow that you’ve added a “small” sm breakpoint, the divs stack on top of each other at the default “extra small” breakpoint, as they are supposed to, but then display evenly across at small or greater widths.\nBootstrap works from smallest to largest, so once you set a grid width for col-sm, they will stay that way for wider widths unless you set another one. You can set the same div to a different number of columns at different widths. However, within a row, the columns need to add up to increments of 12 for each breakpoint if you want them to work properly.\n\nAdjust the three columns to be col-sm-3, col-sm-6 and col-sm-3, respectively.\n\nThis makes the middle column wider when viewed at the “small” breakpoint or wider, but they each still show over all 12 columns when at the extra-small default breakpoint. Note that those column numbers add up to 12. If the total is greater than 12, it breaks into a new column.\nNow we will make these columns all the same width for the medium breakpoint, without changing the small breakpoint.\n\nAfter the col-sm designations in the class, add a space and then this designation for the medium breakpoint: col-md-4. Do this for all three columns.\n\nNow adjust your browser width and see them change between the three breakpoints. Again, note that the column numbers for each size add to a factor of 12 for each breakpoint. i.e, the sm numbers total to 12, and then the md numbers total to 12.\nAs a bit of a check, this part of our code should look like:\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"bg-danger col-sm-3 col-md-4\"&gt;\n      Column\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"bg-warning col-sm-6 col-md-4\"&gt;\n      Column\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"bg-success col-sm-3 col-md-4\"&gt;\n      Column\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nThis is how your page should behave at the default xs, the sm and md breakpoints:\n\n\n25.1.2 xs\nAt the default size (xs), the columns are stacked.\n\n\n\nxs look\n\n\n\n\n25.1.3 sm\nAt the sm size, the middle column is wider.\n\n\n\nsm look\n\n\n\n\n25.1.4 md\nAt the md size, the columns are even.\n\n\n\nmd look\n\n\nNow that we’ve learned a little about columns, we’ll tear this apart and build something useful.",

It works just like a div so we can apply the same bootstrap classes to it.\n\n25.2.1 Processing photos\nWe want to add a photo and caption in the next column, but we don’t have one to use yet. This allows us to talk about an important feature of this project template rig.\nWhen we run gulp or gulp dev a script runs takes all the photos inside the src/img/ folder and processes them for the web, reducing the dpi and compression, before it moves the copy into src/docs/. So, if we use a 2MB jpeg photo in our source folder, it ends up being less than 100k when it is used for our site.\nThis makes our site much faster since the browser doesn’t have to download that huge image. It doesn’t hurt to size down your original source photos anyway, just make sure they are large enough for the widest measure (usually 1200px at 72 dpi is fine unless it’s for a huge display.)\nThe sizing process doesn’t run continuously so we have to launch gulp or gulp dev to process new photos. This is all to say we need to download a photo for our project and restart gulp:\n\nDownload this  Gutenberg Bible at the Harry Ransom Center photo and put it inside your src/img folder.\nStop the gulp dev watch process (Cntl+C in your Terminal window) and then restart it using gulp dev. This will process the photo and make it available in the docs img folder. It’s an important step as photos are only processed when gulp dev starts up.\n\n\n\n25.2.2 Fluid images\nWe’re going to put Figure code into the second column here to get us a photo and caption, but I don’t want you to pull the example code from Bootstrap Documentation because I need to explain how some of it works and that is easier if we build it up ourselves.\n\nReplace the text “Column 2” with the following code:\n&lt;figure class=\"figure\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"img/gutenberg.jpeg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Guetenberg Bible\"&gt;\n  &lt;figcaption class=\"figure-caption\"&gt;A caption for the above image.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\nNow save your HTML page and look at the result in your browser.\n\n\n\nPhoto blows container\n\n\nThe photo blows out of the second column because it is “bigger” than the column it is inside. If you change the width of browser window the photo will always stay that size, which doesn’t work well for us. There is a cool feature to fix this.\nUpdate your code to add the class img-fluid to the image element, so it says class=\"figure-img img-fluid\".\nWhat this img-fluid class does is adjust the width of the photo to the width of its parent element. Your page should look like this now:\n\n\n\nResponsive image with img-fluid\n\n\n\nThis gives us great flexibility in building our responsive website because the photo will shrink and grow to fit the right space!\n\n\n25.2.3 Add a breakpoint\nAs the page gets a little wider, we want give the text a little more space than the photo.\n\nAdd lg sizes to your two columns. Set the first one at 8 columns and the second one at 4 columns.\nSave and check the results. You should see your columns change at the medium and large widths.\n\nWe’ve finished building this part of the pages for now. Next we’ll add the cards to our page.",

Copy the first grid example there and put that inside your container div.\nSave and look at it.

You’ll need to write CSS to make this happen.\nThe nav link for the active page (i.e., the one you are viewing) should be bold. There is a special class for this that you can find in the Bootstrap documentation in the Navbar section.\n\nA jumbotron treatment at the top of the site.\n\nThe jumbotron should have a background image that works reasonably well at all sizes. This is must be done through SCSS using the background shorthand property. You will need to set the image (the url), repeat (no-repeat) and position (center). You’ll need one more style “background-size: cover;” to make it work right.\nFor the background image for the jumbotron, you’ll have to reference it from the scss file. The path for this has to be relative from the compiled css file to the image, so it will be url(../img/filename.jpg). Note the beginning ../ on that path is different than when you call images directly into the index.html page. (In contrast, all your other images referenced in HTML will be src=\"img/filename.jpg\" without the ../ part.)\nSet the main text in the jumbotron to use a Google font of your choice.\n\nA footer with your name in the text.\n\nThe footer should have a background color and the text should be centered with adequate padding.\n\n\n\n\n29.4.2 Index page\nBelow the jumbotron you should have three “cards” that highlight different Kraken.\n\nThe cards should work with a responsive grid so they stack on mobile but are three across at md and larger.\nMake up your own names and details about the monsters. Or use ipsum type, perhaps pirate ipsum.\n\n\n\n29.4.3 Article page\nThe article page should be a two-column responsive layout.\n\nThe columns should stack on mobile, and be side-by-side at medium and larger. There should be different col settings for md and lg so the pirate mugshot doesn’t get too wide.\nThe left column should have the pirate mugshot photo and be responsive to fit the width of the column at different sizes.\n\nThere should be a text byline and the name and source should be different in style or font.\n\nThe right column should a headline and “story” text in multiple paragraphs. (Text can be pirate ipsum or similar.)\n\n\n\n29.4.4 Photos page\nOn the photos page you will build a photo carousel from the three kraken photos.\n\nUse one of the carousel options that has controls to advance the slides.\nAdd some kind of caption for each photo, either under or on top of photo (as long as it is readable).\nSet up the slideshow to use only 8 centered columns at the medium size or greater.

For each of the three core technologies, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we’ve enhanced the base language with tools or systems to make them more efficient to use.\nWhen you built your Bootstrap practice project, you had to completely finish one page before you copied it to create your second page, which means you had lots of duplicate code. If you needed to change something in the Jumbotron, you had to change it on every page. Imagine if your site had hundreds of pages. That’s too labor intensive in the age of computers. With this lesson we’ll introduce a system that allows you to create a template framework that can be used to generate a number of pages with minimal extra effort.\nStatic-Site Generators are an approach to web development that allow you to build a powerful, server-based website locally on your computer, but then compile the pages into a single directory that can be published to a web server without the need of a live database.\nThere are many tools to build static sites using a myriad of programming languages. Some of them have support for themes and other significant customization. Many are built to serve as blogs, but usually they can be coerced into other purposes.\nFor our class, I have provided you a project framework in a repo that uses Node.js and Nunjucks to create a static-app environment.",

As we do so, we’ll just touch on how the example code applies to specific project features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample detail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the pages on the site have a Bootstrap Navbar and a footer. Each page gets this from a single template, so we don’t have to duplicate code for each new page.\nThe index also has a bookstores list down the page a bit, which is a loop over some data. As we explore the code later you’ll see there is only code for one entry, but we repeat that code for every row in data file. In this case the data was downloaded from a Google Sheets spreadsheet, an optional feature of the project. Sometimes having a structured data source like a spreadsheet is helpful.\nThe index also has a listing of three books. This is also built within a “loop” that allows us to repeat the same code over and over. In this case our book data was downloaded from a Google Docs file written in a special structure called ArchieML, developed by The New York Times.\nLastly, there are individual pages for each book listed, which serve as an example of detail pages built from the same template. Only the text and image content is different for each page, but the structure for each page comes from the same template.\nThese specific book pages were created using another feature of the project where we can “bake” pages from data. Instead of a human creating a new file for each library book, they were generated automagically based on data from the Google Doc. If there were 100 books in the data, it would’ve built 100 pages.\n\nStoring our content in Google Docs and Sheets might seem overcomplicated at at first, but it allows us to use Google as a content management system of sorts where many people can collaborate on the content and stay our of our code. It’s super powerful, and used by newsrooms like NYT, NPR and The Texas Tribune.",

Where is the navigation coming from? Or the footer? This is the magic of Nunjucks.\nLook the first line of our index file: {% extends '_templates/base.njk' %}. This Nunjucks extends tag is used with a concept called “template inheritance”. This file, index.njk, is using all the code in _templates/base.njk and then using the Nunjucks block tag to replace and inject code into the base template. This way, we can reuse the base.njk template for every page on our site.\nLet’s look at it from the other direction.\n\nOpen up the file src/_templates/base.njk and take a look at it.\n\nThis file has all the required HTML5 tags, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; and such, that is common to every web page.

We’ll dive into those next.\nSo, to recap again, our index.njk file has that first “extends” line of code that is telling this page to use all the code in in _templates/base.njk (which is the framework of our site), and then anything that follows is being inserted into that framework.",

Some notes about this:\n\nNunjucks block tags start with {% block tag_name %} and end with {% endblock %}.\nThe content inside the tag will display UNLESS you override it later with a new block tag of the same name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also call the block and append code to it using super, but we aren’t doing that here.\n\n\nWe want our site name to be at the beginning of every page title of our site, but then we want to override the actual title of each page with it’s own title.\n\nIn you src/_templates/base.njk file.

In doing this we are replacing the text that is in the “block page_title” in base.njk.\n\nIn your src/index.njk file, in the 3rd line of the file (after the “extends” code), add the following:\n\n{% block page_title %}Capt.

What an include does is when the browser renders the page, it takes all the code inside that nav.njk file and inserts it into that location in the template/page. It’s sorta like a “block” but dumber. We can’t overwrite it. But it is really handy to break up your code into logical files so you can find code later when your website gets complex.\nOur example here is the navigation for the website, which is saved in src/_includes/nav.njk. In maintaining a website, you’ll often go into the navigation and make changes, so it makes sense to put it in separate file where we can easily find it.\nLet’s update the Brand and a link to a new page we’ll add later.\n\nOpen src/_includes/nav.njk.\nFind the navbar-brand segment and update the text “Navbar” to “Pirate Cove”.\nAFTER the line that has &lt;ul class=\"navbar-nav\"&gt; (about line 8), add the following:\n\n      &lt;li class=\"nav-item\"&gt;\n         &lt;a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"{{ relative_path }}pirate-ships.html\"&gt;Pirate ships&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li class=\"nav-item\"&gt;\n         &lt;a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"{{ relative_path }}index-example.html\"&gt;Index example&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\nYou might have to fix in indenting in some of the code block so it lines up with the &lt;/li&gt; that follows it.\nNow, if you look at your index in your browser, you’ll see we’ve added two new navigation links. One is to the original index example (so we can see it later), and the other is a new page that we will create later.\nYou might notice that we have this { relative_path } in front of our URLs here in the nav. Not to get too far into it, but we will need that later when we create new web pages inside folders on our site. Those pages will need to understand where they are in relation to the index.",

    "text": "33.2 Let’s add some data\nOK, are you ready to jump into some advanced features here? We are going to introduce a concept where we have a Google Sheet to manage the editing of data, but then we’ll “fetch” that data into our project so we can use it in the next step.\n\n33.2.1 The data source: Google Sheets\nI have already created a Google Sheet of pirate data. Click on that link so you can take a look at it. Imagine you are in a newsroom and many reporters are gathering data for your project. You could share a Sheet like this with them and they could edit it and create new rows of data. It’s a good way to keep track of stuff.\nOur next trick is to tell our project here to download that data and format it in a way that we can use it. That file type we want in the end is called JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is just “data” for JavaScript. There is a feature built into this project where we can download this data and translate it. One thing to know is the Google Sheet needs to be shared so that “anyone” can view it.\nHere we will “tell” this project about the Google Sheet.\n\nOpen the file in your project called project.config.json.\nAfter the closing } on line 12, we are going to add the following code:\n\n,\n    {\n      \"fileId\": \"1G-aJA1H5C-B05Hlpx2RiojYcsNNXQ5ntvUEArRZ5O6w\",\n      \"type\": \"sheet\",\n      \"name\": \"pirates\"\n    }\nThat first comma in the code above needs to come right after the } that closes out the “bookstores” configuration.\nThe fileId value there is from the URL of the Google Sheet. It’s the long string before /edit/ in the URL, and it is unique to for every Google Sheet (and Doc, for that matter.). The type is “sheet”. the other possible value is “doc”. We’ll do one of those later. The name is what we want the file to be called when it is downloaded.\nWhat we’ve done here is add to a “files” array in this JSON config file. This is a list of all the Google Sheets and Docs used in the project.\nBefore we can download the data we have to stop our browsersync process and run a new one to fetch our data.\n\nGo to your Terminal and do Control-C to stop the browsersync.\nRun gulp fetch. “gulp” is our command and “fetch” is our task.\n\nThe result of the command should download three files. (Two were already in the config – library & bookstores – and we just added the new one “pirates”.)\nThis downloaded all the files to the src/_data/ folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you have a problem with gulp fetch and get an error, you can use these steps to download the data. Do that and then move on with the rest of the lesson, but reach out to me to see if we can fix the problem.\n\n\nGo ahead and open the files at src/data/pirates.json and peek at it. Here is just a snippet:\n{\n  \"ships\": [\n    {\n      \"ship_name\": \"Queen Anne’s Revenge\",\n      \"captain\": \"Edward \\\"Blackbeard\\\" Teach\",\n      \"blurb\": \"Edward \\\"Blackbeard\\\" Teach was one of the most feared pirates in history. In November 1717, he captured La Concorde, a massive French ship used to transport enslaved people. He refitted the Concorde, mounting 40 cannons on board and renaming her Queen Anne's Revenge. With a 40-cannon warship, Blackbeard ruled the Caribbean and the eastern coast of North America. In 1718, the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground and was abandoned. In 1996 searchers found a sunken ship they believe to be the Queen Anne's Revenge in the waters off of North Carolina: some items including a bell and an anchor are on display in local museums.\",\n      \"source\": \"https://www.thoughtco.com/famous-pirate-ships-2136286\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nInside this pirates.json file is an array called “ships”. Think of arrays as a collection of data. We could have more than one array in our file, but right now we only have one.\nInside our “ships” array we have eight items, one for each ship.\nEach item (or ship in our case) has objects that are in key:value pairs. Our first “key” is ship_name and our first “value” is \"Queen Anne’s Revenge\".\nI’ll try to keep all of these terms straight, but I admit I mix them up.\nThe key here is that we have downloaded this data, once we restart our dev environment the data will be “in context”, meaning our program will allow us to access it.\nWe need to build something to hold the data before we can explain how to use it.",

If you open up those docs and peruse them you’ll see there are many different options and configurations. The one we are going to start with is Grid cards.\n\nMake sure gulp dev is running.\nGo to the Grid cards section in the Bootstrap docs and copy the first code selection provided there.\nAfter the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag for the intro, add a new line.\nPaste your code. This already has the row and columns we need.\nSave your file and look at your page.\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\nGrid cards added\n\n\nWe now have four cards on our page with some issues, like our images are broken. We’ll fix those in a minute as we make other adjustments.\nOur plan here is to have a card for each ship in our data. We could create eight cards and use our data inside each card, but what if we add more ships to our data source later? Instead, we’ll create a loop that writes a new card for each ship in our data.\nOur Nunjucks templating system allows for loops like this because it is written in JavaScript. It might help to reference the Nunjucks documentation on “for” loops to see how they work.\nWe’re going to cut our template code down to a single working card, then set this up to repeat for each ship in our data.\n\nIn the cards code, remove all but one of the col/cards. It starts with &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt; and totals 9 lines of code. You want to make sure you still have even opening and closing divs for everything. If you save at this point and look at your page, it should have only one card but otherwise be the same.\nAdd a new line after the closing of the &lt;div class=\"row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 g-4\"&gt; line.\nAdd the following to the new line: {% for ship in pirates.ships %}\nAdd a new line right above the closing &lt;/div&gt; for the row.\nAdd the following to the new line: {% endfor %}\nSave your file and go look at your page.\n\nThat code should look like this, and descriptions follow:\n  &lt;div class=\"row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 g-4\"&gt;\n    {% for ship in pirates.ships %}\n    &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"...\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"card-body\"&gt;\n          &lt;h5 class=\"card-title\"&gt;Card title&lt;/h5&gt;\n          &lt;p class=\"card-text\"&gt;This is a longer card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    {% endfor %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\nNow you have eight cards! But how did it know we have eight ships? Let’s break down what we’ve done here.\nLet’s take this line: {% for ship in pirates.ships %}\n\n{%  %} indicates we are doing special stuff, just like we’ve done before with “blocks” and “extend”.\nfor means we are starting the loop.\nship is what we are calling a single pass through the data. We are “naming” that single item as a “ship” so we can refer later to key values in that row of data. We can use any word we want, but I always use a term logical to the data. We are looping through a bunch of ships, so a single one of those is a single “ship”.\nin pirates.ships is defining which array we are looping through. The “pirates” part is the file we are looking in, and “ships” is the name of the array inside that file.\nEverything after that will get repeated until we reach (% endfor %) which says STOP REPEATING.\n\n\n33.3.1 Remove the broken image link\nWhile it would be cool if we had a photo of each ship to show here, we don’t, so we need to remove the image tag from the template code.\n\nRemove the line with the code: &lt;img src=\"...\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\"&gt;\n\nThat should remove that broken link from all the cards.\n\n\n33.3.2 Update the headline\nAt this point you are thinking “That’s cool, Prof, but they are all the same.” Well, we can pull specific values from the data based on its key.\n\nFor the headline in the &lt;h5 class=\"card-title\"&gt; tag, replace the text “Card title” with this:\n{{ ship.ship_name }}\nSave your file and go look at your page. Now you have a new ship name in each card.\n\nTo call a variable from our data, we use the double curly-brace:\n{{ }}\nThis is opposed to {% %} which does other things.\nSince we named a single item a “ship” in our loop we use that, and then use the dot notation to call the object key:\n{{ ship.ship_name }}\nI like to put spaces around the names for readability, but it is not required.\nOK, now admit that’s kinda cool, right?\n\n\n33.3.3 Update the blurb\nIf we look at our example JSON, we see the key for the description of the ship is called a blurb. So we can use the same style to replace the text in our code with the new value.\n\nGo into the code and replace the text inside the &lt;p class=\"card-text\"&gt; tag with:\n{{ ship.blurb }}\nSave and check your page.\n\nNow you should be showing the description of each ship after the name of the ship.\n\n\n33.3.4 Add a footer link\nIn some of the other Card examples in the Bootstrap documentation there is a card-footer option which would be perfect to use as a link to the webpage with more information about each of our ships. We’ll modify our cards to add this footer and href.\n\nInside the card loop but after card-body closing div, add a blank line.\nAdd the following code:\n&lt;div class=\"card-footer\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"{{ ship.source }}\" class=\"card-link\"&gt;More about the ship&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis code already configured to include the url to the source page found in our data as ship.source.\n\n\n33.3.5 Adding the captain\nThe last thing we need is to add our captain into the card. We don’t have an HTML element to update from our Bootstrap code, so we’ll just add our own.\n\nAfter the &lt;h5&gt; line, add a new blank line.\nIn that new line, add an &lt;h6&gt; and fill it with the code necessary to display the captain’s name. Refer to the JSON example above to figure out what the key value is.\nSave and check.\n\n\n\n33.3.6 Adjusting columns for breakpoints\nThe Grid cards example we pulled from the Bootstrap docs is set to show a single row of cards by default, then two cards per row at the md size and larger. Try making your browser smaller and larger so you can see the change.\nOn wider pages, we could show three cards next to each other, so let’s set that up.\n\nOn the class=\"row\" line just above where the loop starts, add a new class to the ones already there that is row-cols-lg-3.\nSave and check how the cards behave now.\n\n\n\n33.3.7 Fix some display nits\nThe cards are different heights depending on the content. We can adjust that by adding a class to the &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt; element.\n\nFind that “card” element and add this class: h-100\n\nThis sets the card height at 100% across each row. If you review the documentation, there are other little fixes like that you can make depending on your needs.",

    "text": "35.1 Let’s review the example\nTo recreate our Ship’s log blog we are going to introduce two new features: Using Google Docs/ArchieML and “baking” pages.\nBefore we dive into it, let’s go through how the concepts work by looking at the Library Books example included in the project. As we go through it, think about how each book could be a blog post.\nGo back to your site and click on the “Index example” link we added to the nav. The page shows three different books at the top of the page. There is a link at the bottom of each book … click on those and gander at them.\nThis is a screen shot of one of those pages. (It’s a good book. Read it.)\nAll of the individual book pages have the same structure: A book photo on the left, and on the right a headline and blurb about the book.\nAll the book pages were built from the same template, but the content is different. It’s much like amazon.com, where every item for purchase on the site has the same page structure, but the content is different depending on the item you are viewing.\nAll of these book pages were built automagically from a data source. Amazon works similarly, but pulls the item contents from a database. (It’s a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea.)\nHere’s how it works. We’ll work through it one step at at time:",

    "text": "static page example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35.1.1 It starts with data\nThere is a Library books data Google Doc that is viewable to the public.\nTake a look at how that doc is structured. It uses a “language” called ArchieML developed by the New York Times. It allows authors to create structured text in a Google Doc and for that content to be converted into JSON, which is the “data format” for JavaScript. It’s not particularly hard to use (it was created for reporters, after all) but it takes some getting used to.\n\n\n\nArchieML example\n\n\n\nAt the top we have [books], which is names our array. (An “array” is a collection of data.)\nThen each group of lines listed here becomes new entry in our data. Each line starts with a key: and then is followed by a value. The values even support links that get converted to hrefs in our final product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe second page of the Google Doc has some others examples of structured data, but we’ll skip those for now. Just know they are there.\n\n\nThis document is downloaded as data into our project when we run gulp fetch. It is “configured” in the project.config.json file where we earlier added our pirate ships Google Sheets data.\nIn the project.config.json the only difference in using a sheet vs doc is \"type\": \"doc\" vs \"type\": \"sheet\".\n\n\n35.1.2 Peek at the data\n\nGo ahead and open src/data/library.json.\n\nYou’ll see the books array near the top. That’s the only one we are worried about here, but you’ll also see the other example arrays there.\n\n\n\nData example\n\n\nNote how the key names and values match the ArchieML document example above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can use any properly-formatted .json file in this project template as long as it is in the src/_data folder; it doesn’t have to come from a Google Doc or Sheet. Those Google services just give us an easier way to share and edit our data.\n\n\n\n\n35.1.3 The bake template\nOK, so we understand the data, but how are we using it?\nThe baking feature in the project needs three things: The data (got it!), a template to build the pages from, and a configuration to match the data to the template.\n\nOpen up our example template in src/_templates/bake-book.njk so you can review it.\n\nThe first line {% extends '_templates/base.njk' %} gives us the structure of our site. We’ve seen that before.\nThe next line {% set relative_path = \"../\" %} is something we need to include because our generated book pages are created INSIDE another folder like this, books/the-shipping-news.html. (You might remember we included the { relative_path } variable when we added navigation links earlier. To make a long story short, we need both of these things to make navigation links work from these pages.)\nThe next two lines are our page_title and page_description blocks to set those for each book page. You’ll notice that a variable pulling data like { title } is inside those. What’s a little different here than in our pirate ship loop is we don’t have to name what file or array this is coming from. That’s because we handle it later in the project.config.json.\nThen we get to the “block content”. This has our page structure for each book page. It’s set up to be a basic two-column layout with the photo on the left and the text on the right. Note that there are data variables used throughout, assigning data to different places on the page. Again, we just need the “key” name because we define the file and array later.\nThe only other thing new here is { blurb | safe } for the description of the book. blurb is the name of the key value, and the | safe part is something in Nunjucks called a “filter” that allows you to manipulate variable data in some way. In this case safe is allowing us to use HTML in our data, turning links in our Google Doc into hrefs that work.\n\n\n35.1.4 Lastly, the project.config\nIf you open our project.config.json back up and look at the array called \"to_bake\". This is where we define which template should be used with what data. Here is an example and description of each field:\n\"to_bake\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"bake-book\",\n      \"data\": \"library\",\n      \"array\": \"books\",\n      \"slug\": \"slug\",\n      \"path\": \"books\"\n    }\n  ]\n\ntemplate is the name of the template file stored in src/_templates that will be used to build the pages. Note you don’t need the extension in name.\ndata is the name of the data file to build from. You don’t need .json in the name.\narray is the name of the array you are using from the JSON file.\nslug is a key required from the data that will become the filename of each file created. The field used in the data needs to be in a URL-friendly format with all lowercase letters with dashes instead of spaces.\npath is an optional folder to save the files into. Use an empty string to save the files at the root of docs/.\n\n\n\n35.1.5 The generation\nWith these three things: The data, the template, and the config that brings them together, we can run gulp bake (or gulp dev) and a new page will be created in our destination folder for every item in our data. Whether there are three items or 300.\nPretty f’n cool, isn’t it? With a project like this you can create something like a restaurant guide with a unique page for every establishment, all while managing the data in a Google Sheet or Doc.",

Again, consider mobile first and then wider page widths.\nThen work on the loop logic for that part of the assignment. Get the loops working first (just printing an element to the page). Next figure out your HTML structure of the element, then use the loop for the part that should repeat.\nFor the “baking” pages, set up a simple layout and then configure the baking task in project.config.json. Once you get the pages building with data, then continue working on the structure and design of the page.\nOnce all the structure and logic are set, you can then make it all look pretty with HTML/CSS adjustments.\n\nRemember: Think mobile first, then adjust for larger screen widths.",

The most important thing to know is that everyone working on a project should be on the same page, using the same method.\nThe workflow I typically use is git feature branch workflow, and I use this even when I’m working solo on a project. Review the link above, but this is typically how it works:\nThere can be more to it in some shops, like rebasing and squashing, but we won’t get into that here.",
