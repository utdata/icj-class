# Make it pretty and publish

While we aren't finished with this project, I'd like you to clean up what we have and publish it.

## Base styles update

1. There is a margin on the bottom of the nav that is pushing down the jumbotron. There is a style in `src/sass/nav.scss` that you can remove to fix it.

## Index updates

For these, you'll need to do some documentation reading and exploration for the solutions.

1. When viewed on a desktop, the intro text on the index is really wide and not very readable. Play with the column [grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) on the index so that the content uses full width on mobile, but fewer columns at the `md` and higher breakpoints. Look at the [Columns: Horizontal alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#horizontal-alignment) classes to make that content land in the center.
2. Go back into the pirate ships page and then peruse the [Bootstrap cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#background-and-color) docs and look at how you can modify the look of those with colors and styles. Make them look a little nicer. Your choice, but make sure you can read the link text. You can use SCSS to change that color if you wish.

## Publish and check

1. Push all your code to Github.
2. Use Settings to set up Gihub Pages to use the `master/docs` directory.
3. Add your published link to your Gitub repo at the top.
