# If you have gulp fetch problems

Part of the static-apps lesson uses an API to talk to Google Drive to download some files. If you have trouble with `gulp fetch` command and it doesn't work, then you can manually download the data.

- Go to the [data.zip](data.zip) page here.
- Use the **Download** button to download the data.zip file.
- Expand the zip file and put the four files inside the `src/data` folder.
- Restart `gulp dev`.

This will make the data available in your project.
