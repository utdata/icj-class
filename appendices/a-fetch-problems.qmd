# If you have gulp fetch problems

Part of the static-apps lesson uses an API to talk to Google Drive to download some files. If you have trouble with `gulp fetch` command and it doesn't work, then you can manually download the data.

- In your Terminal, use *Cntl-C* to quit the **Browsersync** session.
- Click on this link to download the data: <i class="bi bi-download"></i> [data.zip](data.zip){download="data.zip"}
- Expand the zip file and put the four files inside the `src/_data` folder.
- Restart `gulp dev`.

This will make the data available in your project.
