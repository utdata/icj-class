# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: callout-warning
This class is under a major rewrite for Fall 2023. It pulls together a bunch separate lessons and repos.
:::

This is the course material for the UT-Austin School of Journalism and Media course "Intro Coding for Journalists". The class teaches basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, culminating in a static-page generator app from data.

The online version of the book is [here](utdata.github.io/icj-class/).

The Canvas course is your official word on assignment due dates and such, but most lectures, assignment details and files are found here.

## The structure of the class

You can see the chapter breakdown, but the book is more or less structured like this:

- Using command-line tools
- Computer setup
- HTML: The skeleton of the web
- CSS: The skin of the web
- JavaScript: The muscles of the web
- SASS: Better web skins
- Bootstrap: OMG, the web solved
- Static apps: HFS, I can make it

## A word about my lessons

For all my lessons I typically put directions for YOU to do in numbered lists:

1. Do this thing.
1. Then do that thing.

Sometimes there is code after or among the the directions, but it is in a code block with a grey background.

1. Do this thing:

```bash
$ command --flag
This is the output
```

1. Then do the next thing.
1. Sometimes the code will be in the bullet item itself, but still in a code block. Do this: `$ command`.

I typically use an unordered bullet list for explanations and other non-"do" things:

- This is just a note about something
- And this is another

Regular paragraph text such as this one are usually an explanation, background or whatever.

If **something is in bold** or IN ALL CAPS or _in italics for emphasis_ then there is usually a reason why, so pay attention.

I try to be consistent about such things, but I'm human so sometimes I'm not.

:::callout
Sometimes I put unimportant but interesting side notes in callouts like this.
:::

::: callout-important
But sometimes I'll put important notes in these callout sections, too. I'll usually say if they are important in bold at the beginning, like this one.

## Mac vs PC

On some occaisions I may need to give specific directions depending on your operating system or some other division. You would choose the tab that fits your situation.

## Mac

I use macOS so most directions are from that perspective.

## PC

Usually you can use **Cntl-whatever** no a PC as an equivalent to **Cmd-whatever** on a Mac. You can also use they Help menu to find they keyboard command no matter what playform you use.
