# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: callout-warning
This class is under a major rewrite for Fall 2023. It pulls together a bunch separate lessons and repos.
:::

This is the course material for the UT-Austin School of Journalism and Media course "Intro Coding for Journalists". The class teaches basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, culminating in a static-page generator app from data.

The online version of the book is [here](utdata.github.io/icj-class/).

The Canvas course is your official word on assignment due dates and such, but most lectures, assignment details and files are found here.

## The structure of the class

You can see the chapter breakdown, but the book is more or less structured like this:

- Using command-line tools
- Computer setup
- HTML: The skeleton of the web
- CSS: The skin of the web
- JavaScript: The muscles of the web
- SASS: Better web skins
- Bootstrap: OMG, the web solved
- Static apps: HFS, I can make it

## Tips on reading this book

I try to write this book so it is clear when you need to **do** something vs **read** something.

### To-do steps

For all my lessons I typically put directions for YOU to do in numbered lists:

1. Do this thing.
1. Then do that thing.

---

Sometimes there is code after or among the the directions, but it is in a code block with a grey background.

1. Run this command:

```bash
ls -al
```

---

Sometimes I show a command and also show Terminal output. In this case, I include the `$` on the line with the command. The background is also not highlighted.

```
$ ls -al
total 32
drwxr-xr-x   3 ccm346  Users     96 Jul 12 16:12 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 ccm346  Users    704 Jul 12 16:10 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 ccm346  Users  15642 Jul 12 16:12 data.csv
```

### Not to-do things


I typically use an unordered bullet list for explanations and other non-"do" things:

- This is just a note about something
- And this is another

Regular paragraph text such as this one are usually an explanation, background or whatever.

If **something is in bold** or IN ALL CAPS or _in italics for emphasis_ then there is usually a reason why, so pay attention.

:::callout
Sometimes I put unimportant but interesting side notes in callouts like this.
:::

::: callout-important
But sometimes I'll put important notes in these callout sections, too. I'll usually say if they are important in bold at the beginning, like this one.
:::

I try to be consistent about all such things, but I'm human so sometimes I'm not.

## Mac vs PC

On some occaisions I may need to give specific directions depending on your operating system or some other division. You would choose the tab that fits your situation.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Mac

I use macOS so most directions are from that perspective.

## PC

Usually you can use **Cntl-whatever** as a PC equivalent to **Cmd-whatever** on a Mac.
