# Using Codespaces {.unnumbered}

Up to this point, we've saved our projects in folders on our computer and used Visual Studio Code and our web browser to edit and view them.

Going forward we will bring some more complexity to our development environment, meaning more software is involved.  Since personal computers can run different versions of operating systems and we are working mainly with web technologies, there can be benefits to working on "virtual" computers where everyone's workspace is built in exactly the same way. Many programmers will do this because they can develop software on machines that are exactly the same as those that run the software in production. While our needs are not that keen, we can still take advantage of this concept.

Github has a commercial virtual machine platform called "Codespaces", where you can do all your work in a browser, and it is directly linked to your Github repository. There is nothing to install on your personal computer to make this work. In the situations we will be using it, this service is free.

Spring 2025 will be my first time to use this service as a primary way of working, so there may be hiccups along the way. Be patient, ask questions and we'll muddle through.

## Your first codespace

To get you familiar with Github Codespaces, we're going to do our first "git-practice" project again, but use one of these virtual machines.

1. Go to Github.com, make sure you are logged in, and use the **+** menu at the top-right for a **New Repository**.
    - Give your new repo a name, like `yourname-codespace`.
    - ALSO this time check the box that will **Add a README file**.
    - Leave the other defaults as they are, and click green ***Create repository** button.
2. You'll get to the usual page we get after creating a new repository. However, When you click on the green **Code** button, there will be a tab called **Codespaces**.
    - Click on the **Codespaces** tab, then on the green **Create a codespace on main** button.

At this point the virtual computer will be created and your browser will end up in a window that looks like Visual Studio Code. Your virtual machine will have a cute name made up of random words, like `ideal guacamole`, and you might be able to see that in the folder name in your document tray and in the Codespaces menu at the bottom left of your browser.

### Edit the README

1. Find your README.md file in your document tray and double-click on it to open, just like you would in Visual Studio Code.
1. Update the headline of your readme and add a few sentences.
    - As you type and add files and such, VS Code will save your files automatically.
1. In the Terminal, use the git cycle to add, commit and **push your changes**.
1. Leave this window open, but open a new browser tab and go to your repo on Github, where you should see the changed files.

The virtual codespace works just like your local computer. While the browser is saving your files as your type, you still have to use the git cycle to push your code to your Github repo.

## Codespace settings

There are lots of different preferences that you can set for VS Code in your codespace, and it is possible to save those settings so they can be used within all your codespaces.

### Saving your preferences

These settings get saved to Github so we need to sign into there to connec them.

1. In the VS Code icon menu, not quite at the bottom, is the icon for a user.
1. Click on that "person" icon
    - If it says "Settings Sync is On", then you are already saving your settings and all should be good. You can move on to the next section.
    - If you have a choice of **Back up and Sync Settings**, then choose that.
1. Follow the prompts to **Sign in** using your Github account. (This might force your codespace to restart.)

With this Settings Sync active, changes made to your Settings will be saved and you'll be able to use them in any new codespace.

### Adding extensions

1. In the VS Code icon menus along the left edge, there is a puzzle piece icon to help us intstall extenstions. Click on that icon.
1. In the search box, type in **Nunjucks** and look for the extension by "ronnidc"
1. Click on the **Install** button to add it to your instance.
1. Do the same for **Path Intellisense** by Christian Kohler and install it.

### Editing preferenes

Next we need to adjust our settings to understand how to read Nunjucks files.

1. At the bottom of the VS Code icon bar is a gear. Click on that and gear and go to **Settings**
1. Search for "Emmet include" and this should filter the results to **Emmet: Include languages**.
1. Click on the **Add Item** button.
    - For Item, put: njk
    - For Value, put: html
1. Click on **Add Item** again
    - For Item, put: nunjucks
    - For Value, put: html

In the end, it should look like this:

![Emmet for Nunjucks](../images/emmet-njk.png)

### Other possible settings

> We really should've done these earlier. ðŸ¤·

While optional, there might be some other preferences you might want to save while we are here. You can search for these in search bar:

- **Editor > Word Wrap**: I set this to _on_.
- **Editor > Minimap**: I _uncheck_ this to turn it off. Minimap is the image of your file on the right-edge that allows you to scroll quickly up and down. I find it just takes away from space to edit my file.
- **Editor > Sticky Scroll: Scroll with Editor**:  I _uncheck_ this, but I could see how others might like it. (It's hard to describe in words what this is.)
- **Workbench > Tree: Enable Sticky Scroll**: I _uncheck_ this, but I could see how others might like it.

FWIW, and of these settings can be turned on/off temporarily for a file if you use Cmd+Shift+P and search for it.

### Shutting down your codespace

While a codespace will pause after a bit of inactivity, it is best to shut it down when you are finished working.

1. At the bottom left of the codespace browser window is the _Codespaces_ menu. Click on this, which opens the VS Code command prompt with **Stop current codespace**, which you should choose.

You can also use Cmd-Shift-P to open the command prompt and type in **Stop current codespace** to shut it down.

After it is done, you can close your browser window.

### Restarting codespaces

If you still have the window open, you can click on the **Restart codespace** button.

Otherwise go to your Github repo, click on the big green **<> Code** button and highlight the _Codespaces_ tab. You should see your codespace listed, which you can click on to launch.

## Tips about codespaces

- While your files are automatically saved in the codespace as you work, **you must still commit and push your code to Github** to save it for posterity (and for grading!) I can't see your codespace.
- Your codespace will go dormant if left alone for a period of time. If the window is still open, there will be a button to resume it.
- If you close your browser window, the codespace will go dormant. Your work there is still saved where you left off and you can go to your Github repo to restart the codespace.
- If a codespace is not opened for a month or so, it will be deleted. **So always push your completed code to Github** so it is safe. You will get emails warning you about the deleting.
- If your codespace is deleted for inactivity, you lose any unpushed changes. **Commit and push your code!** That said, you can always create a new codespace based on your most Github repo code.
- It's possible to create more than one codespace for a repo, but that will just confuse you. Just use one.
