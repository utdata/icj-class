# Change Mac shell to bash

Mac Catalina changes the default shell program from **Bash** to **zsh**. While zsh is probably fine, let's change the default shell program to Bash for consistency. This is how to do it:

1. Choose Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Users & Groups.
2. Click the lock, then enter your account name and password.
3. Control-click your user name in the list of users on the left, then choose Advanced Options.
4. Choose a shell from the ”Login shell” menu, then click OK to save the changes.

5. Click OK and close the System Preferences window.
6. Close any Terminal windows you have open and restart them.
