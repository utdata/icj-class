# Setup: Part 1 {.unnumbered}

In order to proceed with this class, you need to do some computer setup. This is handled in separate documentation.

Go to [ICJ Setting Up: Part 1](https://utdata.github.io/icj-setting-up/setup-part-1.html) do those installations and then return here to the next chapter.

We'll do Part 2 at a later time.
