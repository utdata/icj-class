## The card component

I want to introduce our first Bootstrap "component", called  [Bootstrap cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/). A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.
