# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: callout-warning
This class/repo is under a major rewrite for Fall 2023. I might pull together some separate repos and lessons.

This is a guide for the UT-Austin School of Journalism and Media course "Intro Coding for Journalists". The class teaches basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, culminating in a static-page generator app from data.

The online version of the book is [link TK].

The Canvas course is your official word on assignment due dates and such, but most lectures, assignment details and files are found here.

## The structure of the class

You can see the chapter breakdown, but the book is more or less structured like this:

- Using command-line tools.
- Computer setup
- HTML: The skeleton of the web
- CSS: The skin of the web
- JavaScript: The muscles of the web
- SASS: Better web skins
- Bootstrap: OMG, the web solved
- Static apps: HFS, I can make it
