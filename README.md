# README

This class/repo is under a major rewrite for Fall 2023. I might pull together some separate repos and lessons.

This is a guide for the UT-Austin School of Journalism and Media course "Intro Coding for Journalists". The class teaches basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, culminating in a static-page generator app from data.

This book is written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The online version of the book is [link TK].
